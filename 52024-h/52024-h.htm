<p>When the writer was a parson in Yorkshire, he had
in his parish a blacksmith blessed, or afflicted&mdash;which
shall we say?&mdash;with seven daughters and not a son.
Now the parish was a newly constituted one, and it
had a temporary licensed service room; but during the
week before the newly erected church was to be consecrated,
the blacksmith’s wife presented her husband
with a boy&mdash;his first boy. Then the blacksmith
came to the parson, and the following conversation
ensued:&mdash;</p>

<p>Blacksmith: “Please, sir, I’ve gotten a little
lad at last, and I want to have him baptised on
Sunday.”</p>

<p>Parson: “Why, Joseph, put it off till Thursday,
when the new church will be consecrated; then your
little man will be the first child christened in the new
font in the new church.”</p>

<p>Blacksmith (shuffling with his feet, hitching his
shoulders, looking down): “Please, sir, folks say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
t’ fust child as is baptised i’ a new church is bound to
dee (die). T’ old un (the devil) claims it. Now, sir,
I’ve seven little lasses, and but one lad. If this were
a lass again ’twouldn’t ’a’ mattered; but as it’s a lad&mdash;well,
sir, I won’t risk it.”</p>

<p>A curious instance this of a very widespread and
very ancient superstition, the origin of which we shall
arrive at presently.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us see the several forms it
takes.</p>

<p>All over the north of Europe the greatest aversion
is felt to be the first to enter a new building, or to go
over a newly erected bridge. If to do this is not
everywhere and in all cases thought to entail death,
it is considered supremely unlucky. Several German
legends are connected with this superstition. The
reader, if he has been to Aix-la-Chapelle, has doubtless
had the rift in the great door pointed out to him,
and has been told how it came there. The devil and
the architect made a compact that the first should
draw the plans, and the second gain the <i>Kudos</i>; and
the devil’s wage was to be that he should receive
the first who crossed the threshold of the church
when completed. When the building was finished,
the architect’s conscience smote him, and he confessed
the compact to the bishop. “We’ll do him,”
said the prelate; that is to say, he said something
to this effect in terms more appropriate to the century
in which he lived, and to his high ecclesiastical
office.</p>

<p>When the procession formed to enter the minster
for the consecration, the devil lurked in ambush behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a pillar, and fixed his wicked eye on a fine fat
and succulent little chorister as his destined prey.
But alas for his hopes! this fat little boy had been
given his instructions, and, as he neared the great
door, loosed the chain of a wolf and sent it through.
The evil one uttered a howl of rage, snatched up the
wolf and rushed away, giving the door a kick, as he
passed it, that split the solid oak.</p>

<p>The castle of Gleichberg, near Rönskild, was erected
by the devil in one night. The Baron of Gleichberg
was threatened by his foes, and he promised to give
the devil his daughter if he erected the castle before
cockcrow. The nurse overheard the compact, and,
just as the castle was finished, set fire to a stack of
corn. The cock, seeing the light, thought morning
had come, and crowed before the last stone was added
to the walls. The devil in a rage carried off the old
baron&mdash;and served him right&mdash;instead of the maiden.
We shall see presently how this story works into our
subject.</p>

<p>At Frankfort may be seen, on the Sachsenhäuser
Bridge, an iron rod with a gilt cock on the top. This
is the reason: An architect undertook to build the
bridge within a fixed time, but three days before that
on which he had contracted to complete it, the
bridge was only half finished. In his distress he invoked
the devil, who undertook the job if he might
receive the first who crossed the bridge. The work
was done by the appointed day, and then the architect
drove a cock over the bridge. The devil, who
had reckoned on getting a human being, was furious;
he tore the poor cock in two, and flung it with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
violence at the bridge that he knocked two holes in
it, which to the present day cannot be closed, for if
stones are put in by day they are torn out by night.
In memorial of the event, the image of the cock was
set up on the bridge.</p>

<p>Sometimes the owner of a house or barn calls in
the devil, and forfeits his life or his soul by so doing,
which falls to the devil when the building is complete.</p>

<p>And now, without further quotation of examples,
what do they mean? They mean this&mdash;that in remote
times a sacrifice of some sort was offered at the
completion of a building; but not only at the completion&mdash;the
foundation of a house, a castle, a bridge,
a town, even of a church, was laid in blood. In heathen
times a sacrifice was offered to the god under
whose protection the building was placed; in Christian
times, wherever much of old Paganism lingered
on, the sacrifice continued, but was given another
signification. It was said that no edifice would stand
firmly unless the foundations were laid in blood.
Some animal was placed under the corner-stone&mdash;a
dog, a sow, a wolf, a black cock, a goat, sometimes
the body of a malefactor who had been executed for
his crimes.</p>

<p>Here is a ghastly story, given by Thiele in his
“Danish Folk-tales.” Many years ago, when the
ramparts were being raised round Copenhagen, the
wall always sank, so that it was not possible to get it
to stand firm. They, therefore, took a little innocent
girl, placed her in a chair by a table, and gave her
playthings and sweetmeats. While she thus sat enjoying
herself, twelve masons built an arch over her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which, when completed, they covered with earth to
the sound of drums and trumpets. By this process
the walls were made solid.</p>

<p>When, a few years ago, the Bridge Gate of the
Bremen city walls was demolished, the skeleton of a
child was actually found embedded in the foundations.</p>

<p>Heinrich Heine says on this subject: “In the
Middle Ages the opinion prevailed that when any
building was to be erected something living must be
killed, in the blood of which the foundation had to be
laid, by which process the building would be secured
from falling; and in ballads and traditions the remembrance
is still preserved how children and animals
were slaughtered for the purpose of strengthening
large buildings with their blood.”</p>

<p>The story of the walls of Copenhagen comes to us
only as a tradition, but the horrible truth must be
told that in all probability it is no invention of the
fancy, but a fact.</p>

<p>Throughout Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and North
Germany, tradition associates some animal with every
church, and it goes by the name of Kirk-Grim. These
Kirk-Grims are the goblin apparitions of the beasts that
were buried under the foundation-stones of the churches.
It is the same in Devonshire&mdash;the writer will not say
at the present day, but certainly forty or fifty years
ago. Indeed, when he was a boy he drew up a list of
the Kirk-Grims that haunted all the neighbouring
parishes. To the church of the parish in which he
lived, belonged two white sows yoked together with
a silver chain; to another, a black dog; to a third, a
ghostly calf; to a fourth, a white lamb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Afzelius, in his collection of Swedish folk-tales, says:
“Heathen superstition did not fail to show itself in
the construction of Christian churches. In laying the
foundations, the people retained something of their
former religion, and sacrificed to their old deities,
whom they could not forget, some animal, which they
buried alive, either under the foundation or without
the wall. The spectre of this animal is said to wander
about the churchyard at night, and is called the
Kirk-Grim. A tradition has also been preserved that
under the altar of the first Christian churches, a lamb
was usually buried, which imparted security and
duration to the edifice. This is an emblem of the
true Church Lamb&mdash;the Saviour, who is the Corner-Stone
of His Church. When anyone enters a church
at a time when there is no service, he may chance to
see a little lamb spring across the quire and vanish.
This is the church-lamb. When it appears to a person
in the churchyard, particularly to the grave-digger,
it is said to forbode the death of a child.”</p>

<p>Thiele, in his “Danish Folk-tales,” says much the
same of the churches in Denmark. He assures us
that every church there has its Kirk-Grim, which
dwells either in the tower, or in some other place of
concealment.</p>

<p>What lies at the base of all stories of haunted
houses is the same idea. All old mansions had their
foundations laid in blood. This fact is, indeed, forgotten,
but it is not forgotten that a ghostly guard
watches the house, who is accounted for in various
ways, and very often a crime is attributed to one of the
former inhabitants to account for the walking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
ghost. By no means infrequently the crime, which, in
the popular mind, accounts for the ghost, can be demonstrated
historically not to have taken place. Again,
in a great number of cases, the spectre attached to a
building is not that of a human being at all, but of
some animal, and then tradition is completely at a
loss to explain this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The proverb says that there is a skeleton in every
man’s house, and the proverb is a statement of what
at one time was a fact. Every house had its skeleton,
and every house was intended to have its skeleton;
and what was more, every house was designed to
have not only its skeleton, but its ghost.</p>

<p>We are going back to heathen times, when we say
that at the foundation-stone laying of every house,
castle, or bridge, provision was made to give to each
its presiding, haunting, protecting spirit. The idea,
indeed, of providing every building with its spectre,
as its spiritual guard, was not the primary idea, it
grew later, out of the original one, the characteristically
Pagan idea, of a sacrifice associated with the
beginning of every work of importance.</p>

<p>When the primeval savage lived in a hut of poles
over which he stretched skins, he thought little of his
house, which could be carried from place to place
with ease, but directly he began to build of stone, or
raise earthworks as fortifications, he considered himself
engaged on a serious undertaking. He was disturbing
the face of Mother Earth, he was securing to
himself in permanency a portion of that surface which
had been given by her to all her children in common.
Partly with the notion of offering a propitiatory sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the earth, and partly also with the idea of
securing to himself for ever a portion of soil by some
sacramental act, the old Pagan laid the foundations of
his house and fortress in blood.</p>

<p>Every great work was initiated with sacrifice. If a
man started on a journey, he first made an offering.
A warlike expedition was not undertaken till an oblation
had been made, and the recollection of this
lingered on in an altered form of superstition, <i>viz.</i>, that
that side would win the day which was the first to
shed blood, a belief alluded to in the “Lady of the
Lake.” A ship could not be launched without a
sacrifice, and the baptism of a vessel nowadays with
a bottle of wine is a relic of the breaking of the neck
of a human victim and the suffusion of the prow with
blood, just as the burial of a bottle with coins at the
present day under a foundation stone is the faded
reminiscence of the immuring of a human victim.</p>

<p>Building, in early ages, was not so lightly taken in
hand as at present, and the principles of architectural
construction were ill understood. If the walls
showed tokens of settlement, the reason supposed
was that the earth had not been sufficiently propitiated,
and that she refused to bear the superimposed
burden.</p>

<p>Plutarch says that when Romulus was about to
found the Eternal City, by the advice of Etruscan
Augurs, he opened a deep pit, and cast into it the
“first fruits of everything that is reckoned good by
use, or necessary by nature,” and before it was closed
by a great stone, Faustulus and Quinctilius were
killed and laid under it. This place was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Comitium, and from it as a centre, Romulus described
the circuit of the walls.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The legend of
Romulus slaying Remus because he leaned over the
low walls is probably a confused recollection of the
sacrifice of the brothers who were laid under the
bounding wall. According to Pomponius Mela, the
brothers Philæni were buried alive at the Carthaginian
frontier. A dispute having arisen between the
Carthaginians and Cyrenæans about their boundaries,
it was agreed that deputies should start at a fixed
time from each of the cities, and that the place of
their meeting should thenceforth form the limit of
demarcation. The Philæni departed from Carthage,
and advanced much farther than the Cyrenæans.
The latter accused them of having set out before the
time agreed upon, but at length consented to accept
the spot which they had reached as a boundary line,
if the Philæni would submit to be buried alive there.
To this the brothers consented. Here the story is
astray of the truth. Really, the Philæni were buried
at the confines of the Punic territory, to be the ghostly
guardians of the frontier. There can be little doubt
that elsewhere burials took place at boundaries, and
it is possible that the whipping of boys on gang-days
or Rogations may have been a mediæval and
Christian mitigation of an old sacrifice. Certainly
there are many legends of spectres that haunt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
watch frontiers, and these legends point to some such
practice. But let us return to foundations.</p>

<p>In the ballad of the “Cout of Keeldar,” in the
minstrelsy of the Border, it is said,</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“And here beside the mountain flood</div>
<div class="verse i2">  A massy castle frowned,</div>
<div class="verse">Since first the Pictish race in blood</div>
<div class="verse i2">  The haunted pile did found.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">In a note, Sir Walter Scott alludes to the tradition
that the foundation stones of Pictish raths were
bathed in human gore.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurs in the legend of St.
Columba, founder of Iona, which shows how deep a
hold the old custom had taken. The original idea
of a sacrifice to propitiate the earth was gone, but
the idea that appropriation of a site was not possible
without one took its place. The Saint is said to
have buried one of his monks, Oran by name, alive,
under the foundations of his new abbey, because, as
fast as he built, the spirits of the soil demolished by
night what he raised by day. In the life of the Saint
by O’Donnell (Trias Thaumat.) the horrible truth is
disguised. The story is told thus:&mdash;On arriving at
Hy (Iona), St. Columba said, that whoever willed to
die first would ratify the right of the community to
the island by taking corporal possession of it. Then,
for the good of the community, Oran consented to die.
That is all told, the dismal sequel, the immuring of
the living monk, is passed over. More recent legend,
unable to understand the burial alive of a monk, explains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
it in another way. Columba interred him because
he denied the resurrection.</p>

<p>It is certain that the usage remained in practice
long after Europe had become nominally Christian;
how late it continued we shall be able to show
presently.</p>

<p>Grimm, in his “German Mythology,” says: “It
was often considered necessary to build living animals,
even human beings, into the foundations on which any
edifice was reared, as an oblation to the earth to induce
her to bear the superincumbent weight it was
proposed to lay on her. By this horrible practice it
was supposed that the stability of the structure was
assured, as well as other advantages gained.” Good
weather is still thought, in parts of Germany, to be
secured by building a live cock into a wall, and
cattle are prevented from straying by burying a
living blind dog under the threshold of a stable.
The animal is, of course, a substitute for a human
victim, just as the bottle and coins are the modern
substitute for the live beast.</p>

<p>In France, among the peasantry, a new farmhouse
is not entered on till a cock has been killed, and its
blood sprinkled in the rooms. In Poitou, the explanation
given is that if the living are to dwell in the
house, the dead must have first passed through it.
And in Germany, after the interment of a living being
under a foundation was abandoned, it was customary
till comparatively recently to place an empty coffin
under the foundations of a house.</p>

<p>This custom was by no means confined to Pagan
Europe. We find traces of it elsewhere. It is alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to by Joshua in his curse on Jericho which he had
destroyed, “Cursed be the man before the Lord, that
riseth up, and buildeth this city Jericho: <i>he shall lay
the foundation thereof in his firstborn</i>, and in his
youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.” (Josh.
vi. 26.)</p>

<p>The idea of a sacrifice faded out with the spread of
Christianity, and when tenure of soil and of buildings
became fixed and usual, the notion of securing it by
blood disappeared; but in its place rose the notion
of securing a spiritual protector to a building, sacred
or profane, and until quite late, the belief remained
that weak foundations could be strengthened and be
made to stand by burying a living being, generally
human, under them. The thought of a sacrifice to the
Earth goddess was quite lost, but not the conviction
that by a sacrifice the cracking walls could be secured.</p>

<p>The vast bulk of the clergy in the early Middle
Ages were imbued with the superstitions of the race
and age to which they belonged. They were of the
people. They were not reared in seminaries, and so
cut off from the influences of ignorant and superstitious
surroundings. They were a little ahead of their
fellows in culture, but only a little. The mediæval
priest allowed the old Pagan customs to continue unrebuked,
he half believed in them himself. One
curious and profane incident of the close of the fifteenth
century may be quoted to show to how late a date
heathenism lingered mixed up with Christian ideas.
An Italian contemporary historian says, that when
Sessa was besieged by the King of Naples, and ran
short of water, the inhabitants put a consecrated host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in the mouth of an ass, and buried the ass alive in the
porch of the church. Scarcely was this horrible
ceremony completed, before the windows of heaven
were opened, and the rain poured down.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In 1885, Holsworthy parish church was restored,
and in the course of restoration the south-west angle
wall of the church was taken down. In it, embedded
in the mortar and stone, was found a skeleton. The
wall of this portion of the church was faulty, and had
settled. According to the account given by the
masons who found the ghastly remains, there was no
trace of a tomb, but every appearance of the person
having been buried alive, and hurriedly. A mass of
mortar was over the mouth, and the stones were
huddled about the corpse as though hastily heaped
about it, then the wall was leisurely proceeded with.</p>

<p>The parish church of Kirkcudbright was partially
taken down in 1838, when, in removing the lintel of
the west doorhead, a skull of a man was found built
into the wall above the doorway. This parish church
was only erected in 1730, so that this seems to show
a dim reminiscence, at a comparatively recent date,
of the obligation to place some relic of a man in the
wall to insure its stability.</p>

<p>In the walls of the ancient castle of Henneberg,
the seat of a line of powerful counts, is a relieving
arch, and the story goes that a mason engaged on
the castle was induced by the offer of a sum of
money to yield his child to be built into it. The
child was given a cake, and the father stood on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ladder superintending the building. When the last
stone was put in, the child screamed in the wall, and
the man, overwhelmed with self-reproach, lost his
hold, fell from the ladder, and broke his neck. A
similar story is told of the castle of Liebenstein. A
mother sold her child for the purpose. As the wall
rose about the little creature, it cried out, “Mother, I
still see you!” then, later, “Mother, I can hardly see
you!” and lastly, “Mother, I see you no more!” In
the castle of Reichenfels, also, a child was immured,
and the superstitious conviction of the neighbourhood
is, that were the stones that enclose it removed,
the castle would fall.</p>

<p>In the Eifel district, rising out of a gorge is a ridge
on which stand the ruins of two extensive castles,
Ober and Nieder Manderscheid. According to
popular tradition, a young damsel was built into the
wall of Nieder Manderscheid, yet with an opening
left, through which she was fed as long as she was
able to eat. In 1844 the wall at this point was
broken through, and a cavity was discovered in the
depth of the wall, in which a human skeleton actually
was discovered.</p>

<p>The Baron of Winneburg, in the Eifel, ordered a
master mason to erect a strong tower whilst he was
absent. On his return he found that the tower had
not been built, and he threatened to dismiss the
mason. That night someone came to the man and
said to him: “I will help you to complete the tower
in a few days, if you will build your little daughter
into the foundations.” The master consented, and at
midnight the child was laid in the wall, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stones built over her. That is why the tower of
Winneburg is so strong that it cannot be overthrown.</p>

<p>When the church of Blex, in Oldenburg, was
building, the foundations gave way, being laid in
sand. Accordingly, the authorities of the village
crossed the Weser, and bought a child from a poor
mother at Bremerleke, and built it alive into the
foundations. Two children were thus immured in
the basement of the wall of Sandel, one in that of
Ganderkesee. At Butjadeirgen, a portion of the
dyke gave way, therefore a boy named Hugo was
sunk alive in the foundations of the dam. In 1615
Count Anthony Günther of Oldenburg, on visiting a
dyke in process of construction, found the workmen
about to bury an infant under it. The count
interfered, saved the child, reprimanded the dam-builders,
and imprisoned the mother who had sold
her babe for the purpose. Singularly enough, this
same count is declared by tradition to have buried a
living child in the foundations of his castle at Oldenburg.</p>

<p>When Detinetz was built on the Danube, the
Slavonic settlers sent out into the neighbourhood to
capture the first child encountered. A boy was
taken, and walled into the foundations of their town.
Thence the city takes its name, <i>dijete</i> is the Slavonic
for boy.</p>

<p>In the life of Merlin, as given by Nennius and by
Geoffrey of Monmouth, we are told that Vortigern
tried to build a castle, but that the walls gave way as
fast as he erected them. He consulted the wise men,
and they told him that his foundations could only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
made to stand if smeared with the blood of a fatherless
boy. Thus we get the same superstition among
Celts, Slaves, Teutons, and Northmen.</p>

<p>Count Floris III. of Holland, who married Ada,
daughter of Henry, the son of David, King of Scotland,
visited the island of Walcheren in 1157, to
receive the homage of the islanders. On his return
to Holland he despatched a number of experienced
workmen to repair the sea-walls which were in a
dilapidated condition. In one place where the dam
crossed a quicksand, they were unable to make it
stand till they had sunk a live dog in the quicksand.
The dyke is called Hontsdamm to this day. Usually
a live horse was buried in such places, and this horse
haunts the sea-walls; if an incautious person mounts
it, the spectre beast plunges into the sea and dissolves
into foam.</p>

<p>The dog or horse is the substitute for a child. A few
centuries earlier the dyke builders would have reared
it over an infant buried alive. The trace of the substitution
remains in some folk-tales. An architect
promises the devil the soul of the first person who
crosses the threshold of the house, or church, or goes
over the bridge he has built with the devil’s aid. The
evil one expects a human victim, and is put off with
a wolf, or a dog, or a cock. At Aix-la-Chapelle, as
we have seen, a wolf took the place of a human
victim: at Frankfort a cock.</p>

<p>In Yorkshire, the Kirk-Grim is usually a huge
black dog with eyes like saucers, and is called a padfoot.
It generally frequents the church lanes; and
he who sees it knows that he must die within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
year. And now&mdash;to somewhat relieve this ghastly
subject&mdash;I may tell an odd incident connected with
it, to which the writer contributed something.</p>

<p>On a stormy night in November, he was out holding
over his head a big umbrella, that had a handle of
white bone. A sudden gust&mdash;and the umbrella was
whisked out of his hand, and carried away into
infinite darkness and mist of rain.</p>

<p>That same night a friend of his was walking down
a very lonely church lane, between hedges and fields,
without a house near. In the loneliest, most haunted
portion of this lane, his feet, his pulsation and his
breath were suddenly arrested by the sight of a great
black creature, occupying the middle of the way,
shaking itself impatiently, moving forward, then
bounding on one side, then running to the other.
No saucer eyes, it is true, were visible, but it had a
white nose that, to the horrified traveller, seemed lit
with a supernatural phosphoric radiance. Being a
man of intelligence, he would not admit to himself
that he was confronted by the padfoot; he argued
with himself that what he saw was a huge Newfoundland
dog. So he addressed it in broad Yorkshire:
“Sith’ere, lass, don’t be troublesome. There’s a
bonny dog, let me pass. I’ve no stick. I wi’nt
hurt thee. Come, lass, come, let me by.”</p>

<p>At that moment a blast rushed along the lane.
The black dog, monster, padfoot, made a leap upon
the terrified man, who screamed with fear. He felt
claws in him, and he grasped&mdash;an umbrella. Mine!</p>

<p>That this idea of human victims being required to
ensure the stability of a structure is by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
extinct, and that it constitutes a difficulty that has to
be met and overcome in the East, will be seen from
the following interesting extract from a recent
number of the <i>London and China Telegraph</i>. The
writer says:&mdash;“Ever and anon the idea gets abroad
that a certain number of human bodies are wanted,
in connection with laying the foundation of some
building that is in progress; and a senseless panic
ensues, and everyone fears to venture out after nightfall.
The fact that not only is no proof forthcoming
of anyone having been kidnapped, but that, on the
contrary, the circle of friends and acquaintances is
complete, quite fails to allay it. But is there ever
any reasoning with superstition? The idea has
somehow got started; it is a familiar one, and it finds
ready credence. Nor is the belief confined either to
race, creed, or locality. We find it cropping up in
India and Korea, in China and Malaysia, and we
have a strong impression of having read somewhere
of its appearance in Persia. Like the notions of
celibacy and retreat in religion, it is common property&mdash;the
outcome, apparently, of a certain course
of thought rather than of any peculiar surroundings.
The description of the island of Solovetsk in Mr.
Hepworth Dixon’s ‘Free Russia’ might serve,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, for a description of Pootoo; and so
a report of one of these building scares in China
would serve equally well for the Straits. When the
last mail left, an idea had got abroad among the
Coolie population that a number of heads were required
in laying the foundations of some Government
works at Singapore; and so there was a general fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of venturing out after nightfall, lest the adventurer
should be pounced on and decapitated. One might
have thought the ways of the Singapore Government
were better understood! That such ideas should
get abroad about the requirements of Government
even in China or Annam is curious enough;
but the British Government of the Straits above all
others! Yet there it is; the natives had got it into
their heads that the Government stood in need of
960 human heads to ensure the safe completion of
certain public works, and that 480 of the number
were still wanting. Old residents in Shanghai will
remember the outbreak of a very similar panic at
Shanghai, in connection with the building of the
cathedral. The idea got abroad that the Municipal
Council wanted a certain number of human bodies to
bury beneath the foundation of that edifice, and a
general dread of venturing out after nightfall&mdash;especially
of going past the cathedral compound&mdash;prevailed
for weeks, with all kinds of variations and
details. A similar notion was said to be at the
bottom of the riots which broke out last autumn at
Söul. Foreigners&mdash;the missionaries for choice&mdash;were
accused of wanting children for some mysterious
purpose, and the mob seized and decapitated in the
public streets nine Korean officials who were said to
have been parties to kidnapping victims to supply
the want. This, however, seems more akin to the
curious desire for infantile victims which was charged
against missionaries in the famous Honan proclamation
which preceded the Tientsin massacre, and
which was one of the items in the indictment against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Roman Catholics on the occasion of that outbreak.
Sometimes children’s brains are wanted for
medicine, sometimes their eyes are wanted to compound
material for photography. But these, although
cognate, are not precisely similar superstitions to the
one which now has bestirred the population of
Singapore. A case came to us, however, last
autumn, from Calcutta, which is so exactly on all fours
with this latest manifestation, that it would almost
seem as if the idea had travelled like an epidemic
and broken out afresh in a congenial atmosphere.
Four villagers of the Dinagepore district were convicted,
last September, of causing the death of two
Cabulis and injuring a third, for the precise reason
that they had been kidnapping children to be sacrificed
in connection with the building of a railway
bridge over the Mahanuddi. A rumour had got
abroad that such proceedings were in contemplation,
and when these Cabulis came to trade with the
villagers they were denounced as kidnappers and
mobbed. Two were killed outright, their bodies
being flung into the river; while the third, after
being severely handled, escaped by hiding himself.
We are not aware whether the origin of this curious
fancy has ever been investigated and explained, for it
may be taken for granted that, like other superstitions,
it has its origin in some forgotten custom or
faded belief of which a burlesque tradition only
remains. This is not the place to go into a disquisition
on the origin of human sacrifice; but it is not
difficult to believe that, to people who believe in its
efficacy, the idea of offering up human beings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
propitiate the deity, when laying the foundations of
a public edifice, would be natural enough. Whether
the notion which crops up now and again, all over
Asia, really represents the tradition of a practice&mdash;whether
certain monarchs ever did bury human
bodies, as we bury newspapers and coins, beneath the
foundations of their palaces and temples, is a question
we must leave others to answer. It is conceivable
that they may have done so, as an extravagant
form of sacrifice; and it is also conceivable that the
abounding capacity of man for distorting superstitious
imagery, may have come to transmute the idea of
sacrificing human beings as a measure of propitiation,
into that of employing human bodies as actual
elements in the foundation itself. It is possible that
the inhabitants of Dinagepore conserve the more
ideal and spiritual view, which the practical Chinese
mind has materialised, as in the recent instance at
Singapore. Anyhow, the idea is sufficiently wide-spread
and curious to deserve a word of examination
as well as of passing record.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">FIGURE FOUND
UNDER THE FOUNDATIONS
AT STINVEZAND.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the north wall of the parish church of Chulmleigh
in North Devon was taken down a few years
ago&mdash;a wall of Perpendicular date&mdash;in it was found
laid a very early carved figure of Christ crucified to a
vine, or interlacing tree, such as is seen in so-called
Runic monuments. The north wall having been
falling in the fifteenth century, had been re-erected, and
this figure was laid in it, and the wall erected over it,
just as, in the same county, about the same time, the
wall of Holsworthy Church was built over a human
being. At Chulmleigh there was an advance in civilisation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The image was laid over the wall in place
of the living victim.</p>

<p>When, in 1842, the remains of a
Romano-Batavian temple were explored
at Stinvezand, near Rysbergen,
a singular mummy-like object was
found under the foundation. This
was doubtless a substitute for the
human victim.</p>

<p>The stubborn prejudice which still
exists in all parts against a first
burial in a new cemetery or churchyard
is due to the fact that in Pagan
times the first to be buried was the victim, and in
mediæval times was held to be the perquisite of the
devil, who stepped into the place of the Pagan deity.</p>

<p>Every so-called Devil’s Bridge has some story associated
with it pointing to sacrifice, and sometimes to
the substitution of an animal for the human victim.
The almost invariable story is that the devil had
been invoked and promised his aid, if given the first
life that passed over the bridge. On the completion
of the structure a goat, or a dog, or a rabbit is driven
over, and is torn to pieces by the devil. At Pont-la-Ville,
near Courbières, is a four-arched Devil’s Bridge,
where six mice, then six rats, and lastly six cats, were
driven across, according to the popular story, in place
of the eighteen human souls demanded by the Evil
One.</p>

<p>At Cahors, in Ouercy, is a singularly fine bridge
over the Lot, with three towers on it. The lower side
of the middle tower could never be finished, it always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
gave way at one angle. The story goes that the
devil was defrauded of his due&mdash;the soul of the
architect&mdash;when he helped to build the bridge, and
so declared that the bridge never should be finished.
Of late years the tower has been completed, and in
token that modern skill has triumphed, the Evil One
has been represented on the angle, carved in stone.
The legend shows that the vulgar thought that the
bridge should have been laid in blood, and as it was
not so, concluded that the faulty tower was due to
the neglect of the Pagan usage.</p>

<p>The black dog that haunts Peel Castle, and the
bloodhound of Launceston Castle, are the spectres of
the animals buried under their walls, and so the
White Ladies and luminous children, who are
rumoured to appear in certain old mansions, are
the faded recollections of the unfortunate sacrifices
offered when these houses were first reared, not, perhaps,
the present buildings, but the original manor-halls
before the Conquest.</p>

<p>At Coatham, in Yorkshire, is a house where a little
child is seen occasionally&mdash;it vanishes when pursued.
In some German castles the apparition of a child is
called the “Still child;” it is deadly pale, white-clothed,
with a wreath on the head. At Falkenstein,
near Erfurth, the appearance is that of a little maiden
of ten, white as a sheet, with long double plaits of
hair. A white baby haunts Lünisberg, near Aerzen.
I have heard of a house in the West of England,
where on a pane of glass, every cold morning, is
found the scribbling of little fingers. However often
the glass be cleaned, the marks of the ghostly fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
return. The Cauld Lad of Hilton Castle in the
valley of Wear is well known. He is said to wail at
night:</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Wae’s me, wae’s me,</div>
<div class="verse">The acorn’s not yet</div>
<div class="verse">Fallen from the tree</div>
<div class="verse">That’s to grow the wood,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s to make the cradle,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s to rock the bairn,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s to grow to a man,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s to lay me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At Guilsland, in Cumberland, is another Cauld
Lad; he is deadly white, and appears ever shivering
with cold, and his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>An allied apparition is that of the Radiant Boy.
Lord Castlereagh is said to have seen one, a spectre,
which the owner of the castle where he saw it admitted
had been visible to many others. Dr. Kerner
mentions a very similar story, wherein an advocate
and his wife were awakened by a noise and a light,
and saw a beautiful child enveloped in a sort of
glory. I have heard of a similar appearance in a
Lincolnshire house. A story was told me, second-hand,
the other day, of a house where such a child
was seen, which always disappeared at the hearth,
and sometimes, instead of the child, little white hands
were observed held up appealingly above the hearthstone.
The stone was taken up, quite recently, and
some bones found under it, which were submitted to
an eminent comparative anatomist, who pronounced
them to be those of a child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crowe, in her “Night Side of Nature,” gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
an account of such an apparition from an eye-witness,
dated 1824. “Soon after we went to bed, we fell
asleep: it might be between one and two in the morning
when I awoke. I observed that the fire was totally
extinguished; but, although that was the case, and
we had no light, I saw a glimmer in the centre of the
room, which suddenly increased to a bright flame. I
looked out, apprehending that something had caught
fire, when, to my amazement, I beheld a beautiful
boy standing by my bedside, in which position he
remained some minutes, fixing his eyes upon me with
a mild and benevolent expression. He then glided
gently away towards the side of the chimney, where
it is obvious there is no possible egress, and entirely
disappeared. I found myself in total darkness, and
all remained quiet until the usual hour of rising. I
declare this to be a true account of what I saw at
C&mdash;&mdash; Castle, upon my word as a clergyman.”</p>

<p>When we consider that the hearth is the centre
and sacred spot of a house, and that the chimney
above it is the highest portion built, and the most
difficult to rear, it is by no means improbable that
the victim was buried under the hearthstone or jamb
of the chimney. The case already mentioned of a
child’s bones having been found in this position is by
no means an isolated one.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give a tithe of the stories
of White Ladies and Black Ladies and Brown Ladies
who haunt old houses and castles.</p>

<p>The latest instance of a human being having been
immured alive, of which a record remains and which
is well authenticated, is that of Geronimo of Oran, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the wall of the fort near the gate Bab-el-oved, of
Algiers, in 1569. The fort is composed of blocks
of <i>pise</i>, a concrete made of stones, lime, and sand,
mixed in certain proportions, trodden down and
rammed hard into a mould, and exposed to dry in
the sun. When thoroughly baked and solid it is
turned out of the mould, and is then ready for use.
Geronimo was a Christian, who had served in a
Spanish regiment; he was taken by pirates and
made over to the Dey of Algiers. When the fort
was in construction, Geronimo was put into one of
the moulds, and the concrete rammed round him
(18th Sept., 1569), and then the block was put into
the walls. Don Diego de Haedo, the contemporary
author of the “Topography of Algiers,” says, “On
examining with attention the blocks of pise which
form the walls of the fort, a block will be observed in
the north wall of which the surface has sunk in, and
looks as if it had been disturbed; for the body in decaying
left a hollow in the block, which has caused
the sinkage.”</p>

<p>On December 27, 1853, the block was extracted.
The old fort was demolished to make room for the
modern “Fort des vingt-quatre-heures,” under the
direction of Captain Susoni, when a petard which
had been placed beneath two or three courses of pise
near the ground, exploded, and exposed a cavity
containing a human skeleton, the whole of which was
visible, from the neck to the knees, in a perfect state
of preservation. The remains, the cast of the head,
and the broken block of pise, are now in the Cathedral
of Algiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The walls of Scutari are said also to contain the
body of a victim; in this case of a woman, who was
built in, but an opening was left through which her
infant might be passed in to be suckled by her as
long as life remained in the poor creature, after which
the hole was closed.</p>

<p>At Arta also, in the vilajet of Janina, a woman was
walled into the foundation of the bridge. The
gravelly soil gave way, and it was decided that the
only means by which the substructure could be
solidified was by a human life. One of the mason’s
wives brought her husband a bowl with his dinner,
when he dropped his ring into the hole dug for the
pier, and asked her to search for it. When she
descended into the pit, the masons threw in lime and
stones upon her, and buried her.</p>

<p>The following story is told of several churches in
Europe. The masons could not get the walls to
stand, and they resolved among themselves to bury
under them the first woman or child that came to
their works. They took oath to this effect. The
first to arrive was the wife of the master-mason, who
came with the dinner. The men at once fell on her
and walled her into the foundations. One version of
the story is less gruesome. The masons had provided
meat for their work, and the wife of the master
had dealt so carelessly with the provision, that it ran
out before the building was much advanced. She
accordingly put the remaining bones into a cauldron,
and made a soup of vegetables. When she brought
it to the mason, he flew into a rage, and built the
cauldron and bones into the wall, as a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
caution to improvident wives. This is the story told
of the church of Notre Dame at Bruges, where the
cauldron and bones are supposed to be still seen in
the wall. At Tuckebrande are two basins built into
the wall, and various legends not agreeing with one
another are told to account for their presence. Perhaps
these cauldrons contained the blood of victims
of some sort immured to secure the stability of the
edifice.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A very curious usage prevails in Roumania and
Transylvania to the present day, which is a reminiscence
of the old interment in the foundations of a
house. When masons are engaged on the erection
of a new dwelling, they endeavour to catch the
shadow of a stranger passing by and wall it in, and
throw in stones and mortar whilst his shadow rests
on the walls. If no one goes by to cast his shade on
the stones, the masons go in quest of a woman or
child, who does not belong to the place, and, unperceived
by the person, apply a reed to the shadow,
and this reed is then immured; and it is believed
that when this is done, the woman or child thus measured
will languish and die, but luck attaches to the
house. In this we see the survival of the old confusion
between soul and shade. The Manes are the
shadows of the dead. In some places it is said that
a man who has sold his soul to the devil is shadowless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
because soul and shadow are one. But there
are other instances of substitution hardly less curious.
In Holland have been found immured in foundations
curious objects like ninepins, but which are really
rude imitations of babes in their swaddling-bands.
When it became unlawful to bury a child, an image
representing it was laid in the wall in its place. Another
usage was to immure an egg. The egg had in
it life, but undeveloped life, so that by walling it in
the principle of sacrificing a life was maintained
without any shock to human feelings. Another form
of substitution was that of a candle. From an early
period the candle was burnt in place of the sacrifice
of a human victim. At Heliopolis, till the reign of
Amasis, three men were daily sacrificed; but when
Amasis expelled the Hyksos kings, he abolished
these human offerings, and ordered that in their place
three candles should be burned daily on the altar.
In Italy, wax figures, sometimes figures of straw,
were burnt in the place of the former bloody sacrifices.</p>

<p>In the classic tale, at the birth of Meleager, the
three fates were present; Atropos foretold that he
would live as long as the brand then burning on the
hearth remained unconsumed; thereupon his mother,
Althæa, snatched it from the fire, and concealed it in
a chest. When, in after years, Meleager slew one
of his mother’s brothers, she, in a paroxysm of rage
and vengeance, drew forth the brand, and burnt it,
whereupon Meleager died.</p>

<p>In Norse mythology a similar tale is found. The
Norns wandered over the earth, and were one night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
given shelter by the father of Nornagest; the child
lay in a cradle, with two candles burning at the head.
The first two of the Norns bestowed luck and wealth
on the child; but the third and youngest, having
been thrust from her stool in the crush, uttered the
curse, “The child shall live no longer than these
candles burn.” Instantly the eldest of the fateful
sisters snatched the candles up, extinguished them,
and gave them to the mother, with a warning to take
good heed of them.</p>

<p>A story found in Ireland, and Cornwall, and elsewhere,
is to this effect. A man has sold himself to
the devil. When the time comes for him to die, he
is in great alarm; then his wife, or a priest, persuades
the devil to let him live as long as a candle
is unconsumed. At once the candle is extinguished,
and hidden where it can never be found. It is said
that a candle is immured in the chancel wall of
Bridgerule Church, no one knows exactly where.
A few years ago, in a tower of St. Osyth’s
Priory, Essex, a tallow candle was discovered
built in.</p>

<p>As the ancients associated shadow and soul, so
does the superstitious mind nowadays connect soul
with flame. The corpse-candle which comes from a
churchyard and goes to the house where one is to
die, and hovers on the doorstep, is one form of this
idea. In a family in the West of England the elder
of two children had died. On the night of the funeral
the parents saw a little flame come in through the
key-hole and run up to the side of the cradle where
the baby lay. It hovered about it, and presently two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
little flames went back through the key-hole. The
baby was then found to be dead.</p>

<p>In the Arabic metaphysical romance of “Yokkdan,”
the hero, who is brought up by a she-goat on a
solitary island, seeks to discover the principle of life.
He finds that the soul is a whitish luminous vapour
in one of the cavities of the heart, and it burns his
finger when he touches it.</p>

<p>In the German household tale of “Godfather
Death,” a daring man enters a cave, where he finds a
number of candles burning; each represents a man,
and when the light expires, that man whom it represents
dies. “Jack o’ lanterns” are the spirits of men
who have removed landmarks. One of Hebel’s
charming Allemanic poems has reference to this
superstition.</p>

<p>The extinguished torch represents the departed
life, and in Yorkshire it was at one time customary
to bury a candle in a coffin, the modern explanation
being that the deceased needed it to light him on his
road to Paradise; but in reality it represented an extinguished
life, and probably was a substitute for the
human sacrifice which in Pagan times accompanied a
burial. In almost all the old vaults opened in
Woodbury Church, Devon, candles have been found
affixed to the walls. The lamps set in graves in
Italy and Greece were due to the same idea. The
candle took the place of a life, as a dog or sow in
other places was killed instead of a child.</p>

<p>It is curious and significant that great works of art
and architecture should be associated with tragedies.
The Roslyn pillar, the Amiens rose window, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Strassburg clock, many spires, and churches. The
architect of Cologne sold himself to the devil to
obtain the plan. A master and an apprentice carve
pillars or construct windows, and because the apprentice’s
work is best, his master murders him. The
mechanician of a clock is blinded, some say killed, to
prevent him from making another like it. Perdix,
for inventing the compass, was cast down a tower by
Daedalus.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the architect of Cologne
Cathedral, according to the legend, sold himself to
the devil for the plan, and forfeited his life when the
building was in progress. This really means that the
man voluntarily gave himself up to death, probably
to be laid under the tower or at the foundation of the
choir, to ensure the stability of the enormous superstructure,
which he supposed could not be held up in
any other way.</p>

<p>An inspector of dams on the Elbe, in 1813, in his
“Praxis,” relates that, as he was engaged on a
peculiarly difficult dyke, an old peasant advised him
to get a child, and sink it under the foundations.</p>

<p>As an instance of even later date to which the
belief in the necessity of a sacrifice lingered, I may
mention that, in 1843, a new bridge was about to be
built at Halle, in Germany. The people insisted to
the architect and masons that their attempt to make
the piers secure was useless, unless they first immured
a living child in the basement. We may be very
confident that if only fifty years ago people could
be found so ignorant and so superstitious as to
desire to commit such an atrocious crime, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
would not have been restrained in the Middle Ages
from carrying their purpose into execution.</p>

<p>I have already said that originally the sacrifice
was offered to the Earth goddess, to propitiate her,
and obtain her consent to the appropriation of the
soil and to bearing the burden imposed on it. But
the sacrifice had a further meaning. The world
itself, the universe, was a vast fabric, and in almost
all cosmogonies the foundations of the world are laid
in blood. Creation rises out of death. The Norsemen
held that the giant Ymir was slain, that out of
his body the world might be built up. His bones
formed the rocks, his flesh the soil, his blood the
rivers, and his hair the trees and herbage. So among
the Greeks Dionysos Zagreus was the Earth deity,
slain by the Titans, and from his torn flesh sprang
corn and the vine, the grapes were inflated with his
blood, and the earth, his flesh, transubstantiated into
bread. In India, Brahma gave himself to form the
universe. “Purusha is this All; his head is heaven,
the sun is fashioned out of his eyes, the moon out of
his heart, fire comes from his mouth, the winds are
his breath, from his navel is the atmosphere, from his
ears the quarters of the world, and the earth is
trodden out of his feet” (“Rig. Veda” viii. c. 4,
hymn 17-19).</p>

<p>So, in Persia, the Divine Ox, Ahidad, was slain
that the world might be fashioned out of him; and
the Mithraic figures represent this myth. If we put
ourselves back in thought to the period when the
Gospel was proclaimed, we shall understand better
some of its allusions; with this notion of sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
underlying all great undertakings, all <i>constructive</i>
work, we shall see how some of the illustrations used
by the first preachers would come home to those who
heard them. We can see exactly how suitable was
the description given of Christ as the Lamb that was
slain from the foundation of the world. As the
World-Lamb, He was the sustainer of the great
building, He secured its stability; and just as the
sacrifice haunts the building reared on it, so was the
idea of Christ to enter into and haunt all history, all
mythology, all religion.</p>

<p>We see, moreover, the appropriateness of the
symbol of Christ as the chief Corner-stone, and of
the Apostles as foundation stones of the Church;
they are, as it were, the pise blocks, living stones, on
whom the whole superstructure of the spiritual city is
reared.</p>

<p>With extraordinary vividness, moreover, does the
full significance of the old ecclesiastical hymn for the
Dedication of a Church come out when we remember
this wide-spread, deeply-rooted, almost ineradicable
belief.</p>

<p>The tourist on the Rhine, as a matter of duty, visits
in Cologne three points of interest, in addition to
providing himself with a little box of the world-famous
<i>Eau</i>, at the real original Maria Farina’s
factory. After he has “done” the Cathedral, and
the bones of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, he feels
it incumbent on him to pay a visit to the horses’
heads in the market-place, looking out of an attic
window.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_036.png" width="400" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE HORSES’ HEADS, COLOGNE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Myths attach equally to the Minster, the Ursuline
relics, and to the horses’ heads. The devil is said to
have prophesied that the cathedral would never be
completed, yet lo! it
is finished to the last
stone of the spires!
The bones of the
eleven thousand virgins
have been proved to
have come from an
old neglected cemetery,
broken into when
the mediæval walls of Cologne were erected. It
will be shown that the heads of the two grey mares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
near the Church of the Apostles have a very curious
and instructive history attaching to them, and that,
though the story that accounts for their presence on
top of a house is fabulous, their presence is of extreme
interest to the antiquary.</p>

<p>The legend told of these particular heads is shortly
this:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Richmod of Adocht was a wealthy citizen’s
wife at Cologne. She died in 1357, and was buried
with her jewelry about her. At night the sexton
opened her grave, and, because he could not remove
the rings, cut her finger. The blood began to flow,
and she awoke from her cataleptic fit. The sexton
fled panic-stricken. She then walked home, and
knocked at her door, and called up the apprentice,
who, without admitting her, ran upstairs to his
master, to tell him that his wife stood without.
“Pshaw!” said the widower, “as well make me
believe that my pair of greys are looking out of the
attic window.” Hardly were the words spoken, than,
tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;and his horses ascended the staircase,
passed his door, and entered the garret. Next
day every passer-by saw their heads peering from the
window. The greatest difficulty was experienced in
getting the brutes downstairs again. As a remembrance
of this marvel, the horses were stuffed, and
placed where they are now to be seen.</p>

<p>Such is the story as we take it from an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
published in 1816. I had an opportunity a little
while ago of examining the heads. They are of
painted wood.</p>

<p>The story of the resuscitation of the lady is a very
common one, and we are not concerned with this part
of the myth. That which occupies us is the presence
of the horses’ heads in the window. Now, singularly
enough, precisely the same story is told of other
horses’ heads occupying precisely similar positions in
other parts of Germany. We know of at least a
dozen.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It seems therefore probable that the story
is of later origin, and grew up to account for the
presence of the heads, which the popular mind could
not otherwise explain.
This conjecture becomes a
certainty when we find
that pairs of horses’ heads
were at one time a very
general adornment of gable
ends, and that they are so
still in many places.</p>

</div>

<p>In Mecklenburg, Pomerania,
Luneburg, Holstein, it is still customary to affix
carved wooden horse-heads to the apex of the
principal gable of the house. There are usually two
of these, back to back, the heads pointed in opposite
directions. In Tyrol, the heads of chamois occupy
similar positions. The writer of this article was
recently in Silesia, and sketched similar heads on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
gables of wooden houses of modern construction in
the “Giant Mountains.” They are also found in
Russia.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 4.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">ANCIENT GERMAN HOUSE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Originally, in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
and indeed England, all houses were built of
timber, and those which
were not of circular form,
with bee-hive roofs, had
gables. Unfortunately, we
have but one very early
representation of a Teutonic
village, and that is
on the Antonine column
at Rome. One of the bas-reliefs there shows us
the attack by Romans on a German village. The
houses are figured as built of wattled sides, and
thatched over. Most are of bee-hive shape, but one,
that of the chief, is oblong and gabled. The soldiers
are applying torches to the roofs, and, provokingly
enough, we cannot see the gable of the quadrangular
house, because it is obscured by the figure of a German
warrior who is being killed by a Roman soldier.
Though this representation does not help us much,
still there is abundance of evidence to show that the old
German houses&mdash;at least, those of the chiefs&mdash;were
like the dwellings of the Scandinavian Bonders, with
oblong walls with gables, and with but a single main
front and gable a-piece. The Icelandic farmhouses
perpetuate the type to the present day, with some
modifications. These dwellings have lateral walls of
stone and turf scarcely six feet high, and from six to
ten feet thick, to bank out the cold. On these low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
parallel walls rest the principals of the roof, which is
turf-covered. The face of the house is to the south,
it is the only face that shows; the back is banked up
like the sides, so that from every quarter but one
a house looks like a grassy mound. The front consists
of two or more wooden gables, and is all of wood,
often painted red. Originally, we know, there was
but a single gable. At present the subsidiary gable
is low, comparatively insignificant, and contains the
door. Now the old Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and German
houses of the chiefs were all originally constructed
on the same principle, and the timber and
plaster gable fronts of our old houses, the splendid
stone and brick-gabled faces of the halls of the trade
guilds in the market-place at Brussels, and the wonderful
stepped and convoluted house-fronts throughout
Holland and Germany, are direct descendants of the
old rude oblong house of our common forefathers.</p>

<p>We come now to another point, the gable apex.
A gable, of course, is and must be an inverted <i>v</i>, <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_040_1.png" width="23" height="25" alt="inverted v" />;
but there are just three ways in which the apex can
be treated. When the principals are first erected
they form an <i>x</i>, <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_041_1.png" width="25" height="25" alt="x" />, the upper limbs shorter than the
lower. Sometimes they are so left. But sometimes
they are sawn off, and are held together by mortices
into an upright piece of timber. Then the gable
represents an inverted <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_040_2.png" width="24" height="25" alt="inverted y" />. If the ends are sawn
off, and there be no such upright, then there remains
an inverted <i>v</i>, but, to prevent the rotting of the ends
at the apex, a <i>crease</i> like a small <i>v</i> is put over the
juncture, <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_040_3.png" width="14" height="25" alt="inverted V with ^" />. These are the only three variations conceivable.
The last is the latest, and dates from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
introduction of lead, or of tile ridges. By far the
earliest type is the simplest, the leaving of the protruding
ends of the principals forming <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_041_1.png" width="25" height="25" alt="x" />. Then, to
protect these ends from the weather, to prevent the
water from entering the grain, and rotting them, they
were covered with horse-skulls, and thus two horse-skulls
looking in opposite directions became an usual
ornament of the gable of a house. Precisely the same
thing was done with the tie-beams that protruded
under the eaves. These also were exposed with the
grain to the weather, though not to the same extent
as the principals. They also were protected by skulls
being fastened over their ends, and these skulls at the
end of the tie-beams are the prototypes of the corbel-heads
round old Norman churches.</p>

<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons the <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_041_1.png" width="25" height="25" alt="x" /> gable was soon displaced
by that shaped like <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_040_2.png" width="24" height="25" alt="inverted y" />, if we may judge by early
illustrations, but the more archaic and simple construction
prevailed in North Germany and in Scandinavia.
To the present day the carved heads are affixed to
the ends of the principals, and these
heads take the place of the original
skulls. The gable of the Horn
Church in Essex has got an ox’s
head with horns on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">GABLE OF CHURCH, HORN-CHURCH.</span>&mdash;<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>In one Anglo-Saxon miniature
representing a nobleman’s house, a
stag’s head is at the apex. The old Norwegian
wooden church of Wang of the twelfth century, which
was bought and transported to the flanks of the
Schnee-Koppe in Silesia by Frederick William IV.
in 1842, is adorned with two heads of sea-snakes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dragons, one at each end of the gable. In the Rhætian
Alps the gables of old timber houses have on them the
fore-parts of horses, carved out of the ends of the
intersecting principals.</p>

<p>But the horse’s head, sometimes even a human
skull, was also affixed to the upright leg of the inverted
<i>y</i>&mdash;the hipknob,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as architects term it&mdash;partly,
no doubt, as a protection of the cross-cut end from
rain and rotting. But though there was a practical
reason for putting skulls on these exposed timber-ends,
their use was not only practical, they were there
affixed for religious reasons also, and indeed principally
for these.</p>

<p>As a sacrifice was offered when the foundations of
a house were laid, so was a sacrifice offered when the
roof was completed. The roof was especially subject
to the assaults of the wind, and the wind was among
the Northmen and Germans, Odin, Woden, or Wuotan.
Moreover, in high buildings, there was a liability
to their being struck by lightning, and the thunder-god
Thorr had to be propitiated to stave off a fire.
The farmhouses in the Black Forest to the present
day are protected from lightning by poles with
bunches of flowers and leaves on the top, that have
been carried to church on Palm Sunday, and are then
taken home and affixed to the gable, where they
stand throughout the year. The bunch represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the old oblation offered annually to the God of the
Storm.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Horses were especially regarded as sacred
animals by the Germans, the Norsemen, and by
the Slaves. Tacitus tells us that white horses were
kept by the ancient Germans in groves sacred to the
gods; and gave auguries by neighing. The Icelandic
sagas contain many allusions to the old dedication of
horses to the gods. Among the Slaves, horses were
likewise esteemed sacred animals; swords were
planted in the ground, and a horse was led over
them. Auguries were taken by the way in which he
went, whether avoiding or touching the blades. In
like manner the fate of prisoners was determined by
the actions of an oracular horse. When a horse was
killed at a sacrifice, its flesh was eaten. St. Jerome
speaks of the Vandals and other Germanic races as
horse-eaters, and St. Boniface forbade his Thuringian
converts to eat horse-flesh.</p>

<p>The eating of this sort of meat was a sacramental
token of allegiance to Odin. When Hakon,
Athelstan’s foster-son, who had been baptised in
England, refused to partake of the sacrificial banquet
of horse-flesh at the annual Council in Norway, the
Bonders threatened to kill him. A compromise was
arrived at, so odd that it deserves giving in the words
of the saga: “The Bonders pressed the King
strongly to eat horse-flesh; and as he would not
do so, they wanted him to drink the soup; as he
declined, they insisted that he should taste the gravy;
and on his refusal, were about to lay hands on him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Earl Sigurd made peace by inducing the King to
hold his mouth over the handle of the kettle upon
which the fat steam of the boiled horse-flesh had
settled; and the King laid a linen cloth over the
handle, and then gaped above it, and so returned to
his throne; but neither party was satisfied with this.”
This was at the harvest gathering. At Yule, discontent
became so threatening, that King Hakon
was forced to appease the ferment by eating some
bits of horse’s liver.</p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis says of the Irish that in
Ulster a king is thus created: “A white mare is led
into the midst of the people, is killed, cut to pieces
and boiled; then a bath is prepared of the broth.
Into this the King gets, and sitting in it, he eats of
the flesh, the people also standing round partake of
it. He is also required to drink of the broth in
which he has bathed, lapping it with his mouth.”
(“Topography of Ireland,” c. xxv.) This is, perhaps,
the origin of the Irish expression, “a broth of a boy.”</p>

<p>Tacitus tells us that after a defeat of the Chatti,
their conquerors sacrificed horses, ate their flesh,
and hung up their heads in trees, or affixed
them to poles, as offerings to Wuotan. So,
after the defeat of Varus and his legions, when
Cæcina visited the scene of the disaster, he found the
heads of the horses affixed to the branches and trunks
of the trees. Gregory the Great, in a letter to Queen
Brunehild, exhorted her not to suffer the Franks thus
to expose the heads of animals offered in sacrifice.
At the beginning of the fifth century, St. Germanus,
who was addicted to the chase before he was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Bishop of Auxerre, was wont to hang up the heads
and antlers of the game killed in hunting in a huge
pear-tree in the midst of Auxerre, as an oblation to
Odin, regardless of the reproof of his bishop, Amator,
who, to put an end to this continuance of a heathenish
ceremony, cut down the tree.</p>

<p>Adam of Bremen tells of the custom of hanging
men, horses, and dogs at Upsala; and a Christian
who visited the place counted seventy-two bodies.
In Zeeland, in the eleventh century, every ninth
year, men, horses, dogs, and cocks were thus sacrificed,
as Dietmar (Bishop of Merseburg) tells us.
Saxo, the grammarian, at the end of the twelfth
century, describes how horses’ heads were set up on
poles, with pieces of wood stuck in their jaws to keep
them open. The object was to produce terror in the
minds of enemies, and to drive away evil spirits and
the pestilence. For this reason it was, in addition to
the practical one already adduced, that the heads of
horses, men, and other creatures which had been
sacrificed to Odin were fastened to the gables of
houses. The creature offered to the god became, so
to speak, incorporate in the god, partook of the
Divine power, and its skull acted as a protection to
the house, because that skull in some sort represented
the god.</p>

<p>In the Egil’s saga, an old Icelandic chief is said to
have taken a post, fixed a horse’s head on the top,
and to have recited an incantation over it which
carried a curse on Norway and the King and Queen;
when he turned the head inland, it made all the
guardian spirits of the land to fly. This post he fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
into the side of a mountain, with the open jaws
turned towards Norway.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Another Icelander took a
pole, carved a human head at the top, then killed a
mare, slit up the body, inserted the post and set it up
with the head looking towards the residence of an
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>These figures were called Nith-stangs, and their
original force and significance became obscured. The
nith-stang primarily was the head of the victim
offered in sacrifice, lifted up with an invocation to the
god to look on the sacrifice, and in return carry evil
to the houses of all those who wished ill to the
sacrificer. The figure-head of a war-ship was designed
in like manner, to strike terror into the
opponents, and scare away their guardian spirits.
The last trace of the nith-stang as a vehicle of doing
ill was at Basle, where the inhabitants of Great and
Little Basle set up figures at their several ends of the
bridge over the Rhine to outrage each other.</p>

</div>

<p>In Ireland we meet with similar ideas. On the
death of Laeghaire (King Lear), his body was carried
to Tara and interred with his arms and cuirass, and
with his face turned towards his enemies, as if still
threatening them. Eoghan, King of Connaught, was
so buried in Sligo, and as long as his dead head
looked towards Ulster, the Connaught men were
victorious; so the Ulster men disinterred him and
buried him face downwards, and then gained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
victory. According to Welsh tradition, the head of
Bran was buried with the face to France, so that no
invasion could come from thence. A Welsh story
says that the son of Lear bade his companions cut
off his head, take it to the White Hill in London,
and bury it there, with the face directed towards
France. The head of man and beast, when cut off,
was thought to be gifted with oracular powers, and
the piping of the wind in the skulls over the house
gables was interpreted&mdash;as he who consulted it desired.</p>

<p>In an account we have of the Wends in the fifteenth
century, we are told that they set up the heads of
horses and cows on stakes above their stables to
drive away disease from their cattle, and they put the
skull of a horse under the fodder in the manger to
scare away the hobgoblins who ride horses at night.
In Holland, horses’ heads are hung up over pigstyes,
and in Mecklenburg they are placed under the pillows
of the sick to drive away fever. It must be remembered
that pest or fever was formerly, and is still
among the superstitious Slaves, held to be a female
deity or spirit of evil.</p>

<p>Now we can understand whence came the headless
horses, so common in superstition, as premonitions
of death. Sometimes a horse is heard galloping
along a road or through a street. It is seen to
be headless. It stops before a door, or it strikes the
door with its hoof. That is a sure death token.
The reader may recall Albert Dürer’s engraving of
the white horse at a door, waiting for the dead soul
to mount it, that it may bear him away to the doleful
realms of Hæla. In Denmark and North Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the “Hell-horse” is well known. It has three
legs, and is not necessarily headless. It looks in at a
window and neighs for a soul to mount it. The
image of Death on the Pale Horse in the Apocalypse
was not unfamiliar to the Norse and German races.
They knew all about Odin’s white horse that conveyed
souls to the drear abode.</p>



<p>Properly, every village, every house had its own
hell-horse. Indeed, it was not unusual to bury a
live horse in a churchyard, to serve the purpose of
conveying souls. A vault was recently opened in a
church at Görlitz, which was found to contain a skeleton
of a horse only, and this church and yard had
long been believed to be haunted by a hell-horse.
The horse whose head was set up over the gable of a
house was the domestic spirit of the family, retained
to carry the souls away.</p>

<p>The child’s hobby-horse is the degraded hell-horse.
The grey or white hobby was one of the essential
performers in old May Day mummings, and this
represents the pale horse of Odin, as Robin Hood
represents Odin himself.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We see in the hobby-horse
the long beam of the principal with the head at the
end. It was copied therefrom, and the copy remains
long after the original has disappeared from among us.</p>

<p>A man was on his way at night from Oldenburg to
Heiligenhafen. When he came near the gallows-hill
he saw a white horse standing under it. He was
tired, and jumped on its back. The horse went on
with him, but became larger and larger at every step,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and whither that ghostly beast would have carried him
no one can say; but, fortunately, the man flung himself
off the back. In Sweden the village of Hästveda
is said to take its name from häst-hvith, a white horse
which haunts the churchyard and village.</p>

<p>In Bürger’s ballad of Leonore, the dead lover
comes riding at night to the door of the maiden, and
persuades her to mount behind him. Then the horse
dashes off.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>They dash past a graveyard in which is a mourning
train with a coffin. But the funeral is interrupted;
the dead man must follow horse and rider.</p>

</div>

<p>They pass a gallows, round which a ghostly crew
are hovering. The hanging men and the spectral
dance must follow.</p>

<p>The rider carries his bride to a churchyard, and
plunges down with her into a vault.</p>

<p>Bürger has utilised for his ballad a tradition of
Woden as the God of the Dead, carrying off the
souls on his hell-horse. The story is found in many
places; amongst others in Iceland, and variously
modified.</p>

<p>The nightmare is the same horse coming in and
trampling on the sleeper’s chest. The reader will
remember Fuseli’s picture of the head of the spectre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
horse peering in at the sleeper between the curtains
of her bed, whilst an imp sits on and oppresses her
bosom.</p>

<p>But the horse is not always ridden. Modern ideas,
modern luxury, have invaded the phantom world, and
now&mdash;we hear of death-coaches drawn by headless
horses. These are black, like mourning carriages, and
the horses are sable; a driver sits on the box; he is
in black, but he has no weeper to his hat, because he
has not a hat. He has not a hat, because he is without
a head. The death-coach is sometimes not seen,
but heard. At others it is seen, not heard. It rolls
silently as a shadow along the road.</p>

<p>But, indeed, Woden had a black horse as well as
one that was white. Rime-locks (Hrimfaxi) was his
sable steed, and Shining-locks (Skinfaxi) his white
one. The first is the night horse, from whose mane
falls the dew; the second is the day horse, whose
mane is the morning light. One of the legends of St.
Nicholas refers to these two horses, which have been
transferred to him when Woden was displaced. The
saint was travelling with a black and a white steed,
when some evil-minded man cut off their heads at an
inn where they were spending the night. When St.
Nicholas heard what had been done, he sent his
servant to put on the heads again. This the man
did; but so hurriedly and carelessly, that he put the
black head on the white trunk, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In
the morning St. Nicholas saw, when too late, what
had been done. The horses were alive and running.
This legend refers to the morning and the evening
twilights, part night and part day. The morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
twilight has the body dark and the head light; and
the evening twilight has the white trunk and the
black head.</p>

<p>St. Nicholas has taken Odin’s place in other ways.
As Saint Klaus he appears to children at Yule. The
very name is a predicate of the god of the dead. He
is represented as the patron of ships; indeed, St.
Nicholas is a puzzle to ecclesiastical historians&mdash;his
history and his symbols and cult have so little in
common. The reason is, that he has taken to him
the symbols, and myths, and functions of the
Northern god. His ship is Odin’s death-ship, constructed
out of dead men’s finger and toe-nails.</p>

</div>

<p>In Denmark, a shovelful of oats is thrown out at
Yule for Saint Klaus’s horse; if this be neglected,
death enters the house and claims a soul. When a
person is convalescent after a dangerous illness, he is
said to have “given a feed to Death’s Horse.” The
identification is complete. Formerly, the last bundle
of oats in a field was cast into the air by the reapers
“for Odin at Yule to feed his horse.” And in the
writer’s recollection it was customary in Devon for
the last sheaf to be raised in the air with the cry,
“A neck Weeday!” That is to “Nickar Woden.”</p>

<p>The sheaf of corn, which is fastened in Norway and
Denmark to the gable of a house, is now supposed to
be an offering to the birds; originally, it was a feed
for the pale horse of the death-god Woden. And
now we see the origin of the bush which is set up
when a roof is completed, and also of the floral hip-knobs
of Gothic buildings. Both are relics of the
oblation affixed to the gable made to the horse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Woden,&mdash;corn, or hay, or grass; and this is also the
origin of the “palms,” poles with bouquets at the
top, erected in the Black Forest to keep off
lightning.</p>

<p>A little while ago the writer was at Pilsen in
Bohemia, and was
struck with the gables
in the great square.
Each terminated in a
vase of flowers or
fruit, or some floral
ornament, except only
the Town Hall, which
had three gables, each
surmounted by spikes
of iron, and spikes
stood between each gable, and each spike transfixed
a ball. The floral representations are far-away remembrances
of the bunch of corn and hay offered to
Woden’s horse, but the balls on the spikes recall the
human skulls set up to his honour. That the skulls
were offerings to a god was forgotten, and those set
up were the heads of criminals. The Rath-Haus had
them, not the private houses, because only the town
council had a right to execute.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, among ourselves
down to the end of last century, heads of traitors and
criminals were thus stuck up on spikes over city
gates, and town halls, and castles. Those executed
by justice were treated according to immemorial and
heathen custom. A new meaning was given to the
loathsome exhibition. It deterred from treason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
crime. Nevertheless, our Christian mediæval rulers
simply carried out the
old custom of offering
the heads to Odin, by
setting them up above
the gables. Skulls and
decaying heads came to
be so thoroughly regarded
as a part&mdash;an
integral ornament of a
gate or a gable&mdash;that
when architects built
renaissance houses and gateways, they set up stone
balls on them as substitutes for the heads which were
no more available. A lord with power of life and
death put heads over his gate; it was the sign that
he enjoyed capital rights. The stone balls on lodge
gates are their lineal descendants. Some manors
were without capital jurisdiction, and the lords of
these had no right to set up heads, or sham heads, or
stone balls. If they did so they were like the modern
<i>parvenu</i> who assumes armorial bearings to which he
has no heraldic right.</p>



<p>When the writer was a boy, he lived for some years
in a town of the south of France, where was a house
that had been built by one of the executioners in the
Reign of Terror. This man had adorned the pediment
of his house with stone balls, and the popular
belief was that each ball represented a human head
that he had guillotined. Whether it was so or not,
we cannot say. It was, perhaps, an unfounded belief,
but the people were right in holding that the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
balls used as architectural adornments were the representatives
of human heads.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Pilsen market-place, it
was remarkable that only the
Town Hall had balls on it, and
balls in the place where there
had previously been spiked
heads. No private citizen
ventured to assume the cognisance
of right of life and
death.</p>



<p>At Chartres all the pinnacles of the cathedral are
surmounted by carved human heads.</p>

<p>In the farmhouse of Tresmarrow in Cornwall, in a
niche, is preserved a human skull. <i>Why</i> it is there,
no one knows. It has been several times buried, but,
whenever buried, noises ensue which disturb the
household, and the skull is disinterred and replaced
in its niche. Formerly it occupied the gable head.</p>

<p>As already said, these heads were regarded as
oracular. In one of Grimm’s “Folk-Tales” a King
marries a chamber-maid by mistake for her mistress,
a princess, who is obliged to keep geese. The
princess’s horse is killed, and its head set up over the
city gate. When the princess drives her geese out of
the town she addresses the head, and the head
answers and counsels her. So in Norse mythology
Odin had a human head embalmed, and had recourse
to it for advice when in any doubt. In the tale of
the Greek King and Douban, the Physician, in the
Arabian Nights’ Tales, the physician’s head, when he
is decapitated, is set on a vase, where it rebukes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
King. Friar Bacon’s brazen head whereby he conjured
is a reminiscence of these oracular heads.</p>

<p>In one of the Icelandic Sagas, the gable ends
whistle in the wind, and give oracles according to the
tone or manner in which they pipe.</p>



<p>The busts that occupy niches in Italian buildings
are far-off remembrances of
the real human heads which
adorned the fronts of the
wigwams of our savage
ancestors. So, also, as already
said, are the head
corbels of Norman buildings.</p>

<p>On old Devonshire houses,
the first ridge-tile on the
main gable was very
commonly moulded to
represent a horse and
his rider. The popular
explanation is that these
tiles were put up over
the houses where Charles
I. slept; but this is a
mistake; they are found
where Charles I. never was.</p>

<p>At one time they were pretty common. Now some
remain, but only a few, at
Plymouth, Exeter, Totnes,
Tavistock, and at East
Looe, and Padstow, in
Cornwall. One at Truro
represents a horse bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
skins on the back, and is so contrived as to whistle in
the wind. None are earlier than the seventeenth
century, yet they certainly take
the place of more ancient figures,
and they carry us back in
thought to the period when the
horse or horse-head was the
ornament proper to every gable.
These little tile-horses and men
are of divine ancestry. They trace back to Wuotan
and his hell-horse.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The historical existence of the leaders Hengest and
Horsa, who led the Anglo-Saxons to the conquest of
Britain, has long been disputed. There probably
never were such personages. What is more likely
is that they were the horse-headed beams of the
chief’s house of the invading tribe. Both names
indicate horses. When the Norsemen moved their
quarters, they took the main beams of their dwellings
with them, and they took omens from these beams,
when they warped or whistled in wet and wind. The
first settlers in Iceland threw their house-beams into
the sea off Norway, and colonised at the spot where
they were washed ashore on the black volcanic sands
of Iceland.</p>

<p>The white horse in the arms of Kent, the white
horse on the Hanovarian coat, the white horses on the
chalk downs throughout Wessex, have all reference
to Woden and his grey hell-horse. The greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
respect was paid to the main principals of the roof
with their horse-heads. We can understand how
that when the old house in the market-place at
Cologne was rebuilt, the old heads were retained;
and when the original skulls decayed, they were replaced
with painted wooden imitations; just as in
the Norman churches the skull-like corbels of stone,
and in Gothic churches the monstrous gaping gurgoyles,
and on our Elizabethan mansions the stone
balls, also the figure-heads on ships, all trace back to
real heads of sacrificed beasts and men.</p>

<p>In 1877 it was found necessary to pull down the
spire terminating the bell-turret surmounting the
western gable of St. Cuthbert’s Church, Elsdon,
Northumberland. In the spire, immediately over
the bell, was discovered a small chamber, without any
opening to it, and within this, nearly filling the cavity,
were three horse-heads, or rather skulls, piled in a
triangular form, the jaws uppermost. The receptacle
had been made for them with some care, and then
they had been walled up in it.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On the tower of the Church of Sorau in Lusatia
are two heads, one is that of a woman, the other
that of a horse. The story told to account for them
is this. A girl was drawing water at the fountain in
the market-place, when a horse, filled with madness,
rushed at her. She fled round the market-place
pursued by the horse, which was gaining on her,
when, seeing the door into the tower open, she ran in,
and up the winding stair. Arrived at the top, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
stopped to breathe, when, to her dismay, she heard
the clatter of the horse’s hoofs on the steps; the
creature was pursuing her up the tower. In her terror
she leaped from the bell window, and the horse
leaped after her. Both were dashed to pieces on the
pavement. The heads were set up on stone as a
memorial of the event.</p>

<p>In 1429 the town of Budissin was besieged by the
Hussites. The town notary, Peter Prichwitz, promised
to open the gates to the investing forces, but
his treachery was discovered in time, and the traitor
was executed on December 6th, in the market-place,
and when he had been drawn and quartered, his
quarters were set up over the bastions, and his head
carved in stone above the city gate, and this remains
to the present day.</p>

<p>Here we have two instances, and many more could
be adduced, of these carved heads being made to
represent the heads of certain persons who have died
violent deaths.</p>

<p>The first instance is peculiarly interesting. The
story, however, as little explains the figures as does
that of Richmod of Adocht at Cologne. There is a
great deal of evidence to show that till a late period,
when a lofty tower or spire was erected, human or
animal victims were cast from the top, to ensure
the erection from being struck by lightning. The
woman and the horse at Sorau had been thus
offered. We know that this was a mode of sacrifice
to Odin. Victims to him were flung down precipices.</p>

<p>In North Germany, at the close of the last century,
on St. James’s day, it was customary to throw a goat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with gilt horns and adorned with ribbons from the
top of a church or town hall tower. At Ypres, on
the second Wednesday in Lent, cats were flung down
from the tower. Abraham à Santa Clara says that
three illustrious Italian families, those of Torelli,
Pieschi, and Gonzaga, have white ladies who appear
before death; these are the spirits of three damsels
who were falsely accused of incontinence, and were
precipitated from the topmost battlements of the
towers belonging to these three families. Now it is
clear that Abraham à Santa Clara has got his story
wrong. The coincidence would be extraordinary in
all three families. The real explanation is, that when
the several castles of these families were erected, from
the highest tower of each a virgin was cast down as
a superstitious insurance against lightning, actually&mdash;though
this was forgotten&mdash;because from immemorial
times such a sacrifice had been offered.</p>

<p>In 1514 the spire of the Cathedral Church of
Copenhagen was erected. A carpenter’s assistant
had an altercation with his master, as to which had
the steadiest brain. Then the master ran a beam
out from the top of the tower, took an axe in his
hand, walked out on the beam, and struck the axe
into the end of it. “There,” said he to his man, on
his return, “go out and recover the axe.”</p>

<p>The assistant instantly obeyed. He walked out;
but when he was stooping to take hold of the axe it
seemed to him that it was double. Then he asked,
“Master, <i>which</i> of them?”</p>

<p>The master saw that he had lost his head, and that
it was all up with the man, so he said, “God be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
your soul!” At the same moment the man fell, and
was dashed to pieces in the market-place at the foot
of the tower.</p>

<p>It is possible that this may be the true version
of the story; but it is much more likely that the
man was flung down by his master, with deliberate
purpose, to secure by his death the stability of
the spire he had erected.</p>

<p>A very similar story
is told of the tower of
Assier Church in the
Department of Lot.
This singular renaissance
church was erected
by Galiot de Ginouillac,
Grand Master of Artillery
under Francis I.
On the roof of the
central tower are three
wooden pinnacles. The
story goes that De Ginouillac
ascended with
his son to the top of the tower, and bade the boy
affix the cross. The lad walked along the ledge and
exclaimed, “Father, which of the pinnacles is in the
middle?” When the father heard that, he knew his
son had lost his head. Next moment the boy fell
and was dashed to pieces. Popular superstition held
that so high a tower, with so steep a roof, must be
consecrated by the sacrifice of a life.</p>

<p>Countless stories remain concerning spires and
towers indicating similar tragedies; but we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
further concerned with them than to point out that
the heads carved on towers may, and in some cases
certainly do, refer to a life sacrificed to secure the
tower’s stability.</p>

<p>An ancestor of the writer in the seventeenth century
visited China, and brought home a puzzle which became
an heirloom in the family. The puzzle, fast locked,
remains; but the secret how to open it is forgotten.
Many a puzzling custom and usage comes down to
us from the remote past; the clue to interpret it has
been lost, and wrong keys have been applied to unlock
the mystery, but the patience and research of
the comparative mythologist and the ethnologist are
bringing about their results, and one by one the
secrets are discovered and the locks fly open.</p>

<p>When Tristram and Ysonde were driven from the
Court of Mark, King of Cornwall, they fled to a
forest of “holts and hills,” and there found and inhabited
an “erthe house” which “etenes, bi old
dayse had wrought;” that is to say, a house constructed
by the giants of old. King Mark came that
way one day when hunting, and looking in saw
Ysonde asleep, with a patch of sunlight about to fall
on her closed eyes through the tiny orifice which
alone served as chimney and window to the “erthe
house;” and, very considerately, he stuffed his glove
into the hole, so as to prevent her sleep being
broken.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>That earth house built by the vanished race of the
giants was, there can be little question, a bee-hive
hut such as are to be found over the Cornish moors.
When Thomas of Erceldoune wrote in the thirteenth
century, the origin of these bee-hive huts was already
lost in fable.</p>

<p>Of these bee-hive huts there remain thousands&mdash;nay,
tens of thousands&mdash;in more or less ruinous condition,
on the Cornish moors and on Dartmoor. They
are found also in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. The
structure of the bee-hive hut is this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>A circle was described in the grass, in diameter from
6 feet to 9 feet. Then a second circle, concentric, 3
feet beyond the first, that is to say, with a diameter
12 feet to 15 feet. Stones were set up on end in the
ground where these circles had been described, and
walls of horizontal slabs were laid between and on
these uprights, their interstices filled in with moss
and turf. After the walls had been carried to the
height of four feet, the horizontal courses were drawn
together inwards, so as to form a dome of overlapping
slabs, and in the centre an opening was left to admit
light and to serve as a smoke-hole, but sufficiently
small to be easily closed with a stone or a wad of
turf. On the south side of this bee-hive habitation a
door was contrived by planting two jambs in the soil
at right angles to the walls, standing about 2 feet 6
inches high, and placing over these a broad flat slab
as lintel, on which the structure of the dome could be
continued, and could rest.</p>

<p>There are several of these huts still in existence as
perfect as when first made. One is on the Erme on
Dartmoor; it is almost buried in heather, and might
be passed without observation as a mere mound.
The door remains, and it will serve the pedestrian, as
it has served many a shepherd, as a place of refuge
from a shower. There are three or four under and on
Brown Willy, the highest peak of the Cornish moors.
Connected with one of these is a smaller hut of
similar structure that served apparently as a store
chamber.</p>

<p>Comparatively few are perfect. The vast majority
have fallen in. All were not originally domed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with stones, some&mdash;the majority&mdash;were roofed over
by planting sticks in the walls and gathering them
together in the centre, and then thatching them with
reed, or packing turf round the beams. This we
judge from the ruins. Some give evidence of having
been domed, by the amount of stone that has fallen
within the circle of the foundations; others, on the
other hand, are deep in turf and peat, and show no
fallen stones within the ring.</p>

<p>Very often clusters of these circular hovels are
enclosed within a circular wall of defence. The
villages were, in
a word, defended
against assault.
At Grimspound on
Dartmoor is such a
walled village. The
pound contains
four acres; a stream
is ingeniously diverted
from its
course and brought within the enclosure. There
remain the ruins of about twenty-five huts, but
there are scattered heaps that indicate the former
existence of other habitations which have been destroyed.
Near Post Bridge, in the heart of Dartmoor,
are the remains of something like fourteen village
enclosures, whereof one contains about forty of these
huts.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> An account of a very numerous and remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
group within fortifications, near Holyhead, was
published by the Hon. W. O. Stanley in 1871. He
explored the settlement with the spade.</p>

<p>Who inhabited these bee-hive huts? Certainly the
tin-workers. Mr. Stanley satisfied himself that the
dwellers in the bee-hive huts of Holyhead were metal-workers.
He found their tools, fused metal, and
scoria. The villages in Cornwall and on Dartmoor
have unaccountably been left unexplored, but there
is some evidence to show that they were occupied by
those who “streamed” for tin.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how folk-tradition has preserved
some reminiscence of a large and of a small race as
existing in Northern Europe before the Keltic
wave, and also before the Scandinavian wave rolled
west. The smallest race is generally associated in
tradition with the rude stone monuments. The
dolmens are <i>cabannes des fees</i>, or caves of dwarfs;
whereas the giants are spoken of as inhabiting
natural caverns. The early mythical sagas of the
Norse are full of such mention, and the pedigrees
give us evidence of the intermarriage between the
newly-arrived Scandinavians and the people they found
in the land before them. It is certainly a remarkable
coincidence that the cave men, as revealed to us by
the skeletons of the Vézère, of Solutrè, and Mentone,
should have been men of about seven feet high.
When the Cymri and Gaels invaded our isles, a
population of blended blood was subjugated, and
became vassal to the Kelt, worked for it in the mines,
and tended the flocks on the wolds, and the swine in
the oak woods for the new masters. The Kelt knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the use of iron. He had not come from the East
in quite the same way as the people of rude stone
monuments. He came along the shores of the Black
Sea, passed up the Danube, and, crossing the Rhine,
poured over the Jura and the Vosges into the plains
of Gaul. He met the stone monument builder at the
head waters of the Seine, and drove him back; he
stopped his passage of the Rhine; and it is possible that
it was this arrest which forced the polished-stone man
to cross the Pyrenees and people the Iberian peninsula.</p>

</div>

<p>We have strayed from our subject&mdash;the bee-hive
hut. On no part of Dartmoor have the miners
worked so vigorously and so continuously as on the
East Webber, at Vitifer. Here, on a slope, is to
be found a collection of bee-hive hut foundations.
The ground below, above, and along one side
has been turned up to the depth of fourteen to
twenty feet; but the tin searchers have avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the little settlement, leaving the huts on a sort of
peninsula of unworked gravel, a clear evidence that
the workers were those who occupied these huts.
When we come to the date of these habitations we
are unable to arrive at any very satisfactory conclusion.
Some of these settlements certainly date back
from the age of the rude stone monument builders,
and to that of the polished stone weapons.</p>

<p>It is noticeable in Cornwall and on Dartmoor that
the clusters of hut circles are generally associated
on the one hand with tin stream works, and on the
other with avenues and circles of upright stones, and
that the heights of the hills near them are topped
with cairns that contain kistvaens, or graves of rude
stones, set on end and capped with large granite
coverers. It may be taken as almost certain that
where there is a large cluster of these dwellings, there
will be found some megalithic monument hard by, or
if not, that the enclosures, or the moor, will bear
some name, such as Ninestones, or The Twelve Men
(Maen = a stone), that testifies to there having been a
circle there, which has been destroyed. With tin
works the circles of hut foundations are invariably
associated. In Holyhead, where is the cluster of bee-hive
huts examined by Mr. Stanley, there also are to be
found the Meinihirion, long stones, two stones standing
ten feet apart, rising eleven feet above the soil,
and originally surrounded by a circle of upright stones,
now removed to serve as gate posts, or to form
fences. There is sufficient evidence to show that the
first builders of the bee-hive huts were the men of
that race which erected the rude stone monuments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our island, and who also worked the tin. But what
race was that? It was not Keltic. It was in our
island before the Britons arrived. We can trace its
course of migration from the steppes of Asia by the
monuments it erected. This mysterious people came
to the Baltic and followed its shores, some crossed
into what was afterwards Scandinavia, but the main
tide rolled along the sea-shore. They have left their
huge stone monuments in Pomerania, in Hanover.
They crossed the Rhine, and from Calais saw the
white cliffs of Albion and one large branch of the
stream invaded and colonised the British Isles. Another,
still hugging the sea, passed along the coast of
Gaul to Brittany, thence descended the shores of the
Bay of Biscay, sent settlers up the Seine, the Loire,
and the Dordogne, swept on into the Iberian peninsula,
crossed into Africa, and after setting up circles
and dolmens in Algeria, disappeared. They never
penetrated to the centre of Germany; the Oder, and
the Elbe, and the Rhine offered them no attractions.
They were a people of rocks and stones, and they
were not attracted by the vast plains of Lower Germany;
they never saw, never set up a stone in the
highlands, in the Black Forest, or the Alps. But it
was otherwise with the great rivers of Gaul; with the
sole exception of the Rhone they followed them up.
Their monuments are numerous on the Loire; they
are as dense in the upper waters of the Lot and
Tarn as they are among the islets and on the headlands
of Brittany. It is doubtful if they ever set foot
in Italy. Such was the course taken by the great
people which migrated to Europe. But another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
branch had separated at the Caspian, and had turned
South. It passed over the Tigris and Euphrates, and
occupied both Palestine and Arabia. The Palestine
exploration has led to the discovery of numerous
remains in that land, identical in character with those
found everywhere else where this people sojourned.
And Mr. Palgrave was startled to find that Arabia
had its Stonehenges precisely like that which figures
on the Wiltshire Downs.</p>

<p>The researches of French antiquaries have led to
the conclusion that the men who set up these great
stone monuments were those who used weapons of
polished flint and chert. Precisely the same conclusion
has been reached by the archæologists of Scotland.
Bronze was indeed employed, but at a later
period; and then bronze and polished stone were
used together.</p>

<p>In the tumuli of Great Britain and of Gaul, two
distinct types of heads are found. These are the
long and the round bullet skull. In France, before
the dawn of history, there seems to have been as
great a mixture of races as there is at present. It is
not possible for us in England to determine the succession
of peoples and civilisations as nicely as can
be done in France, for we have not such deposits of
the remains of successive populations superposed as
they have in Perigord. Under the overhanging
limestone cliffs on the Vézère, men lived in succession
one age on another to the present day, from the first
who set foot on the soil, and by digging through
these beds to the depth of forty feet, we obtain the
remains of these men in their order&mdash;</p>

may be followed in their remains. What became
of them we know not. Perhaps they migrated
north after the reindeer.</p>

<p>The Neolithic men erected the rude stone monuments,
the circles of upright stones. They were the
men of Stonehenge and of Carnac. But this race was
not pure. Its skulls exhibit a great mixture of character
and kind, and it is probable that it took up
into it other peoples subjugated on its way west and
south. Perhaps it also was conquered. We cannot
tell; but it seems from certain indications that it was
so, and that by the metal-working race.</p>

<p>When the Gaels and Cymri invaded our isles, they
found them peopled, and peopled by various races,
and these they in turn subjugated.</p>

<p>We know but very little of the primitive populations
of our isles and of Europe; and a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
what we think we know is due to guesswork based on
a few observations.</p>

<p>As far as we can judge, the dwellers in bee-hive huts
were the same as those who erected the rude stone
monuments, but it does not follow that the Megalithic
monument builders did not impose their customs
on the race they conquered; and indeed it is possible,
even probable, that a people conquering them may
have adopted their religious ideas and their methods
of interment.</p>

<p>It is curious to note how that in legend the subjugated
people are supposed to live in earth mounds.
No story is more common than that of a man passing
a mound at night and seeing it open, and finding that
merriment and drinking are going on within. Sometimes
children are snatched away, and are brought
up in these mounds. He who desires to have a
sword of perfect temper goes to one of the mounds,
taps, and bargains with the mound-dweller to make
him a sword. The name now given to the race&mdash;not
a pure, but a mixed one&mdash;that occupied the land
before the dawn of history, is Ivernian. It was a
dark-haired and sallow-complexioned race. The
Kelt was fair; and if in Ireland, and in Cornwall, and
in France so much dark hair and dusky skin is
found, this is due to the self-assertion of the primitive
race that was subjugated by the blue-eyed,
fair-haired conquerors from the Black Sea and the
Danube.</p>

<p>What was the conquered race? “What,” asks the
author of “Chaldæa,” in the “Story of the Nations,”
“What is this great race which we find everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
at the very roots of history, so that not only ancient
tradition calls them ‘the oldest of men,’ but modern
science more and more inclines to the same opinion?
Whence came it?” And the answer Mme. Ragozin
gives to the question is&mdash;that this was the yellow
Turanian people which overflowed from the steppes
of Northern Asia, which carried with it thence
acquaintance with the metals, and through this acquaintance
established itself as masters wherever it
went. That may be, but before this Ivernian race
arrived in the west, whatever it was, it found that
man had been on the soil before it&mdash;aye, and for
ages on ages&mdash;occupying caves, hunting the reindeer
and the horse, ignorant of the art of the potter, and
yet in some particulars his superior in intellectual
power.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Although the bee-hive hut may have originated
with the dark-haired Ivernian metal-worker, it by no
means follows that it was not in use long after, to a
comparatively recent period. As we have seen,
Tristan and Ysonde took refuge in one. The bee-hive
hut is still in employ in the Hebrides. I will
quote a most interesting account of one by Dr. A.
Mitchell. “I turn now to a more remarkable form
of dwelling which is still tenanted, but is just passing
into complete disuse. Nearly all the specimens of
it remaining in Scotland are to be found in the
Lewis and Harris, or other islands of the outer
Hebrides. There are probably only from twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to thirty now in occupation, and although some
old ones may yet be repaired, it is not likely
that a new one will ever again be built. The newest
we know of is not yet a century old. It was still
occupied in 1866, and was built by the grandfather
of a gentleman who died a few years ago in
Liverpool.</p>

<p>(<i>From Mitchell: The Past and the Present.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>“My first visit to one of these houses was paid in
1866, in the company of Captain Thomas. They are
commonly spoken of as bee-hive houses, but their
Gaelic name is <i>bo’h</i> or <i>bothay</i>. They are now only
used as temporary residences or shealings by
those who herd the cattle at their summer pasturage;
but at a time not very remote they are
believed to have been the permanent dwellings of
the people.</p>

<p>“We had good guides, and were not long in reaching
Larach Tigh Dhubhstail. As we had been led to
expect, we found one of these bee-hive houses
actually tenanted, and the family happened to be at
home. It consisted of three young women. It was
Sunday, and they had made their toilette with care
at the burn, and had put on their printed calico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
gowns. None of them could speak English; but
they were not illiterate, for one of them was reading
a Gaelic Bible. They showed no alarm at our
coming, but invited us into the <i>bo’h</i>, and hospitably
treated us to milk. They were courteously dignified,
neither feeling nor affecting to feel embarrassment.
There was no evidence of any understanding on their
part that we should experience surprise at their surroundings.
I confess, however, to having shown, as
well as felt, the effects of the wine of astonishment.
I do not think I ever came upon a scene which more
surprised me, and scarcely know where and how to
begin my description of it.</p>

<p>“By the side of a burn which flowed through a
little grassy glen, we saw two small round hive-like
hillocks, not much higher than a man, joined together,
and covered with grass and weeds. Out of
the top of one of them a column of smoke slowly
rose, and at its base there was a hole about three
feet high and two feet wide, which seemed to lead
into the interior of the hillock&mdash;its hollowness, and
the possibility of its having a human creature within
it being thus suggested. There was no one, however,
actually in the <i>bo’h</i>, the three girls, when we came in
sight, being seated on a knoll by the burnside, but
it was really in the inside of these two green hillocks
that they slept, and cooked their food, and carried on
their work, and&mdash;dwelt, in short.</p>

<p>“The dwelling consisted of two apartments opening
into each other. Though externally the two
blocks looked round in their outline, and were in fact
nearly so, internally the one apartment might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
described as irregularly round, and the other as
irregularly square. The rounder of the two was the
larger and was the dwelling-room. The squarish
and smaller one was the store-room for the milk and
food. The floor
space of this last
was about six feet
in its shorter and
nine feet in its longer
diameter. The
greatest height of
the living room&mdash;in
its centre, that
is&mdash;was scarcely
six feet. In no
part of the dairy was it possible to stand erect. The
door of communication between the two rooms was
so small that we could get through it only by creeping.
The great thickness of the walls, six to eight
feet, gave this door, or passage of communication,
the look of a tunnel, and made the creeping through
it very real. The creeping was only a little less
real in getting through the equally tunnel-like,
though somewhat wider and loftier passage which
led from the open air into the first, or dwelling-room.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“At the right hand side on entering there was the
fireplace. The smoke escaped at a small opening at
the apex of the dome. The floor was divided into
two spaces by a row of curb-stones eight or nine
inches high. These served as seats, the only seats
in the house; but they at the same time cut off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
part of the floor on which the inmates slept, the bed,
in short&mdash;the whole space behind the row of stones
being covered with hay and rushes. In the part of
the wall bounding the bed there were three niches or
presses, in which, among other things, we observed a
hair-comb and some newly-made cheeses. The walls
of these bee-hive huts are built of rough, undressed
stones gathered from the moor, which are of fair size,
but not larger than one or two men could easily lift
and put into position. The dome shape, or bee-hive
form, is given by making the successive courses of
stone overlap each other, till at length they approach
so closely all round as to leave nothing but a small
hole, which can be either closed by a large sod, or
left open for the escape of smoke or the admission of
light. I need scarcely say that no cement is used.
The principle of the arch is ignored, and the mode of
construction is that of the oldest known masonry.
Though the stone walls are very thick, they are soon
covered on the outside with turf, which soon becomes
grassy like the land round about, and thus
secures perfect wind and water tightness.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Now, this extremely interesting account shows us
two things. First, that we can not safely conclude
from the structure of a bee-hive hut that it belongs to
a pre-historic date. We are only justified in so
asserting when we find it in connection with
megalithic monuments, or when the spade in exploring
it reveals implements of bronze or stone.
Secondly, we see how man clings to tradition, how
that actually at the present day men will occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
habitations on precisely the model of those erected
by the population of Great Britain ages before the
Roman set foot on our land.</p>

<p>It may be said, and with some justice, that there is
no certainty that the bee-hive hut was not a mode
of construction adopted by many different races.
This is true. The huts in the vineyards on the river
Lot in France are of precisely the same construction.
In the south of Africa the Kaffir, at the sources of
the Nile the Niams, build themselves circular huts of
clay and wattles. Nevertheless, when we find this sort
of hut identical in structure to the smallest particular,
as far apart as the Desert of Beersheba, and the
dunes of Brittany, the Hebrides, the Cornish
peninsula, and the Pyrenees,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and very generally
associated with megalithic monuments, we may safely
conclude that they are the remains of one primitive
people, and if in later ages similar habitations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
been raised, it is because that with the blood, the traditions
of that race have been continued.</p>

<p>How striking is this passage from Dr. Geikie’s
“Holy Land and the Bible.” He says, “In the Wilderness
of Beersheba are bee-hive huts of stone, conjectured
to be ancient native houses of the Amalekites.
They are from seven to eight ft. in diameter, with a
small door of two uprights and a lintel, about two ft.
square. In one dwelling a flint arrowhead and some
shells were found. <i>Close by are some circles of upright
stones.</i> The whole country was at one time inhabited.
Nearly every hill has ancient dwellings on the top
and stone circles, also great cairns. The extraordinary
resemblance, the identity in every point so
struck Professor Palmer, who discovered this settlement,
that in his ‘Desert of Exodus’ he engraved a
Cornish bee-hive hut to show how it was a counterpart
to the huts of Beersheba.”</p>

<p>(<i>Dog Kennel under Shelf.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>But these bee-hive huts are themselves a reproduction
in stone of the tents with which the primeval
race wandered on the steppes of the Altai before ever
they reached Palestine on the one hand and Europe
on the other. The Nomad made his tent of skins
stretched on poles. It was circular, and the smoke
escaped through a hole in the top. When he ceased
to ramble, he constructed his habitation on the same
principle exactly as his tent, circular and domed. On
the Siberian tundras and in Lapland there are still in
use two sorts of huts; one, the smoke-hut, is precisely
like a bee-hive habitation. It is, however, too small
to allow of a fire being kept burning in the centre,
and it is heated in this way&mdash;a fire is kindled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then allowed to go out. When extinct, the chimney
hole at the top is closed, and the owner retires into
his hut, which retains the heat for a great many hours.
Sometimes, however, like the <i>bo’h</i> in the Hebrides,
the fire is at the side, but owing to the smallness of
the hovel, must be kept low. Castrén, in his travels
among the Samojeds and Ostjaks, was sometimes
obliged to spend months in one of these huts. At
first he was obliged to go outside in all weathers,
climb up the side of the hut and plug his chimney to
keep in the warmth; but after a while he rigged up a
bundle of old cloth attached to a pulley, and he was
able by this means to block the opening from within,
by pulling a string.</p>

</div>

<p>A very similar hut is still in use among the Finns,
but no longer as a habitation. It is employed for
bathing purposes. A fire is lighted in it, and stones
are heated in the fire red hot, then plunged in a vessel
of water. This generates steam, and the bather enters
the bee-hive hut, shuts the door, and is parboiled in
the steam. Now, the inconvenience of these bee-hive
huts was obvious. Intense heat could be generated
in them, but owing to their smallness, a whole family
could not live in one. In the Fostbraethra Saga,
an Icelandic account of transactions in the eleventh
century, that comes to us in a twelfth century form, is
an account of how one Thormod went to Greenland.
Having committed a murder there, he took refuge
with an old woman in her hut. When his foes came
to seek him, she lit a fire on the hearth, and filled the
hut with smoke, so that they could not see who was
in it. But one man climbed on the roof and pulled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
plug out of the chimney hole, whereupon the atmosphere
within cleared. In time the long house with
four corners to it was discovered or adopted. This
was an immense advance in comfort. But, at the
same time, the peculiar advantage of the bee-hive
hut was not lost sight of. If human beings had been
baked and boiled therein&mdash;why not their bread and
their meat? They saw that a bee-hive hut was a hot-air
chamber retaining the heat for an extraordinary
length of time. So the next step in civilisation was
to build the bee-hive hut on a smaller scale for the
sake of boiling and stewing. In the year 1891 I
exhumed on the edge of Trewortha Marsh, on the
Cornish moors, an ancient settlement. The houses
were all oblong. The principal house consisted of
two great halls. The upper hall was divided by stone
screens into stalls, and in front of each stall had been
formerly a hearth. In each stall a family had lived,
each family had enjoyed its own fire, burning on the
ground. But such an open fire would not bake. The
inmates had knowledge of corn, for we found a hand
quern for grinding it. In order to bake, they had
erected independent huts, with bee-hive ovens in the
walls, identical in structure with the old bee-hive huts,
and the reddened stones showed that fires had been
lighted in these for baking purposes. But that was
not all, we found heaps of burnt pebbles about the size
of a goose-egg. These had been employed for throwing
into vessels of water either to boil them, or to
generate steam for baking purposes.</p>

<p>A common English word has completely lost its
primitive signification. That word is <i>stove</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
stove is the Norse word <i>stofa</i>, and the German <i>stube</i>.
It does not mean a heating apparatus, but a warm
chamber.</p>



<p>There is a curious old book, “The Gardener’s Dictionary,”
by Philip Miller, the fourth edition of which
was published in 1754. He gives an account of
greenhouses and conservatories as places usually unheated.
“I suppose,” says he, “many people will be
surprised to see me direct the making of flues under
a greenhouse; but though perhaps it may happen
that there will be no necessity to make any fires in
them for two or three years together, yet in very
hard winters they will prove extremely useful.” But
when the author comes to hothouses, he describes
them under the name of “<i>stoves</i>.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 22.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">EARTHENWARE OVEN AS IN USE

</div>

<p>The stove is
a hot chamber,
heated
maybe by an
oven, but we
have turned
the name about,
and we
apply it mistakenly
to
the heating
apparatus.</p>



<p>In Germany the room that is heated is the <i>stube</i>,
but the heater is the <i>ofen</i>. The <i>ofen</i> is, however,
itself a reproduction in small of the hot chamber.
The oven is employed to radiate outwards in heating
a room; it radiates inwards when employed for baking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The German <i>ofen</i>, or, as we would term it, stove,
is an earthenware vessel in a room. A fire is lighted
in it, till it is thoroughly heated. Then the fire is allowed
to expire, and the damper is turned, effectually
closing the flue. Thenceforth all the heat
within and in the earthenware
walls radiates into the apartment,
and keeps it warm for
eight or nine hours. In the
ancient oven, as in the bee-hive
huts at Trewortha, every precaution
was adopted to retain
the heat. The outside was banked up with peat, and
the heat gathered within baked bread or meat.</p>

<p>The bee-hive oven of courses of stone was not all
that could be desired. The fire acted on the granite
or limestone or slate, and split or crumbled it, and
when one or two stones gave way, the whole dome
collapsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while a further advance was made. The
bee-hive hut was constructed of earthenware, of clay
baked hard, so as to resist fire for an indefinite number
of years. Now in the West of England in every
cottage may be seen one of these “cloam” ovens. It
is in structure a bee-hive hut precisely. The old
tradition hangs on, is followed from century to century
and year to year, and he who looks at these ovens
may think of the story they tell&mdash;of the ages unnumbered
that have passed since the type was fixed by
the tent of the wanderer on the Siberian steppes, of
the changes that type has gone through, of the stone
bee-hive hut supplanting the tent of skins, of the
bee-hive hut abandoned for the house with four corners,
and the old hut converted into a baking oven,
and then finally of the adoption of the oven of
“cloam.” In another ten or fifteen years that also
will have passed
away, to be replaced
by the
iron square
oven, and then
one of the links
that attach us
to that remote
past, to that
mysterious race
that Mme. Ragotzin
says “lies at the roots of all history,” a race
which has marked its course by gigantic structures,
but has left behind it no history&mdash;then, I say, one of
the last links will be broken.</p>

<p>I had let my house. Two days after, I received the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="right">“Friday.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="ind">“In the best bedroom is a four-post bed. Mrs.
C. assures me that it will be quite impossible for her to invite
any friend to stay with her unless the four-poster be removed,
and its place occupied by a brass or iron double-tester. Four-posters
are entirely exploded articles. I will trouble you to
see to this at your earliest convenience this week.</p>

<p class="right">
“Yours faithfully,<br />
“C. C.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of course I complied. Two years ago I went
to a sale. As I was not very well I did not
remain, but left word with my agent to buy
certain articles for me. Next day a waggon arrived
with my purchases, and among them&mdash;a mahogany
four-post bed. “Why, good gracious! I do
not want <i>that</i>.” “It was going so cheap, and is of
solid mahogany,” answered my agent, “so I thought
you ought to have it.” That four-poster has never
been put together. It lies now in an outhouse with a
chaff-cutter, empty cement barrels, and much rubbish.
It probably never will be used, except by
boring woodworms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw some little while ago in one of the illustrated
papers a recommendation how to make use of old
carved four-post beds&mdash;that is to say, of the carved
four posts. Let them be sawn through, and converted
into massive picture frames or ornamental chimney-pieces.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the four-poster is doomed to extinction,
for it has a history, and it attaches us to our
Scandinavian ancestry.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans had nothing of the sort.
Their beds were not closed in on all sides; it is a
little doubtful whether these beds were very comfortable.
In great houses they were richly ornamented, the
legs enriched with ivory, and were sometimes even of
precious metal. They were covered with silk and
tissues of interwoven gold; but somehow in classic
literature we do not come upon much that speaks of
the luxurious comfort of a bed. In the charming
passage on Sleep in the first Ode of the Second Book,
Horace makes no allusion to the bed as having any
relation to sleep, does not hang upon it tenderly as
something to be fond of. The bedroom of a Roman
house was a mere closet. The Roman flung himself
on a bed because he was obliged to take some rest,
not because he loved to sink among feathers, and
enjoy repose.</p>

<p>The modern Italian bed is descended by direct
filiation from the classic <i>lectus</i>, and what an uncomfortable
article it is! There are plenty of representations
of ancient beds on tombstones and on vases;
they are not attractive; they look very hard, unpleasantly
deficient in soft mattresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The Roman noble had his <i>lectica</i>&mdash;a litter enclosed
within curtains&mdash;in which he was carried about. One
of bronze, inlaid with silver, is preserved in the
Palace of the Conservators at Rome. Now and then
mosquito curtains were used round a bed, and Horace
represents the rout of the forces of Antony at
Actium as due to the disgust entertained by the
Roman legionaries at seeing their general employ
mosquito curtains to his bed at night. The couches
on which guests and host reclined at dinner were, in
fact, beds, and they had curtains or a sort of a canopy
over them. Great fun is made by Fundanius in his
account to Horace of a banquet in the house of a
<i>nouveau-riche</i>, of the fall of the canopy on the table
during dinner, covering all the meats and dishes, and
filling the goblets with a cloud of black dust.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>But the true four-poster derives from the north.
The Briton had it not when invaded by the Romans,
and the Roman did not teach the Briton to construct
it.</p>

<p>The Saxon did not bring his four-poster with him,
nor did the Jute or the Angle, for the four-poster
was unknown to these Teutonic peoples. It came to
us with the “hardy Norseman.”</p>

<p>Let us see what was the construction of a Scandinavian
house. The house consisted of one great hall
that served most purposes (<i>skali</i>). In it men and
women ate and drank, the dinner was cooked, work
was done when the weather was bad, and there also
were the beds. In addition to the hall, there was in
the greatest houses a ladies’ bower (<i>badstòfa</i>), but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with that we need not concern ourselves. The hall
consisted of a nave and side aisles. The walls of the
aisles were of stone, banked up with turf, but the roof
was of timber throughout. Down the centre of the
hall ran a trough, paved with stone, in which fires
burnt, and parallel with this long hearth were
benches. It was not always that fires were maintained
through the whole length of the hall; one
alone was in general use in the centre, and here was
the principal seat&mdash;that occupied by the master of
the house, and opposite him, beyond the fire, was the
second seat of honour. The roof was sustained by a
row of beams, or pillars, and the space of the aisles
was occupied by beds. At an entertainment, curtains
were hung along the sides from post to post, concealing
the beds, but some of the bed compartments were
boxed in, both at back, foot, and front, between the
pillars, and had in front doors by which admission
was obtained to them, and a man who retired to rest
in one of these <i>lokrekkjur</i>, or <i>lokhvilur</i>, as they were
called, fastened himself in. The object of these press
beds was protection. When, as among the Norsemen,
every man revenged himself with his own hand
for a wrong done, it was necessary for each man
who was sensible that he had enemies, to provide
that he was not fallen upon in his sleep. In the Icelandic
Saga of Gisli Sursson, relating to incidents
in the tenth century, is a story that illustrates this.
As this saga is exceedingly curious, I venture here to
give the substance:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Hawkdale in Iceland lived two brothers, Thorkel
and Gisli. “Sons of Whey,” they were called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
because, when their father’s house had been set on fire,
they and he had extinguished the flames with vats of
curds and whey. Thorkel had to wife a woman
named Asgerda, and Gisli was married to Auda,
sister of his intimate friend Vestein. Their sister
Thordisa was married to a certain Thorgrim. The
brothers and brothers-in-law were great merchants,
and went trafficking to Norway and Denmark.
Gisli and Vestein were partners in one vessel, and
went one way; Thorkel and Thorgrim were in partnership,
and went their way. But the brothers were
very good friends; they and their wives lived together
in one house, and managed the farm in common.
Thorkel, however, was a proud man, and would
not put his hand to farm work, whereas Gisli was
always ready to do what was needed by night or by
day. Things prospered, and it occurred to Gisli that
if they took an oath of close brotherhood, they would
each stand by the other, and would be too strong to
meet with opposition in their quarter of the island.
Accordingly the four men proceeded to a headland,
cut a piece of turf so that it remained attached to
the soil at both ends, raised it on a spear, and passing
under it, opened their veins and dropped their
mingled blood into the mould from which the strip
of turf had been cut. Then they were to join hands,
and swear eternal fellowship. But at this moment
Thorgrim drew back his hand&mdash;he was ready to be
brother to Thorkel and Gisli, but not to Gisli’s brother-in-law,
Vestein. Thereat Gisli withdrew his hand, and
declared that he would not pledge eternal brotherhood
with a man who would not be friends with Vestein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Gisli went to his forge and broke a coin
there with the hammer in two parts, and gave one
half to Vestein, and bade him preserve it. At any
time, when one desired to communicate with the
other in a matter of supreme importance, he was to
send to the other the broken token.</p>

<p>On one of his voyages, Gisli was a winter at
Viborg, in Denmark, and he there picked up just so
much Christianity that he resolved never again to
sacrifice to Thor and Freya.</p>

<p>He returned to Iceland in the same week as did
his brother Thorkel; and as it was hay weather, at
once turned up his sleeves, and went forth with all
his house churls, haymaking. Thorkel, on the other
hand, flung himself on a bench in the hall, and went
to sleep. When he awoke, he heard voices, and
dreamily listened to the gossip of his wife and sister-in-law,
who were cutting out garments in the ladies’
bower. “I wish,” said Asgerda, “that you would cut
me out a shirt for my husband Thorkel.” “I am no
better hand at cutting out than you are,” answered
Auda. “I am sure of one thing, if it were anything
that was wanted doing for my brother, Vestein, you
would not ask for my help or for anyone else to assist
you.” “Maybe,” said Asgerda, “I always did admire
Vestein, and I have heard it said that Thorgrim was
sweet on you before Gisli snapped you away.” “This
is idle talk,” said Auda.</p>

<p>Then up stood Thorkel, and striding in at the
door, said, “This is dangerous talk, and it is talk that
will draw blood.”</p>

<p>The women stood aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this Thorkel told his brother that he
wished to divide the inheritance with him. Gisli
regretted this, and endeavoured to dissuade him, but
in vain. They cast lots, and the movable goods fell
to Thorkel, the farm to Gisli. Thereupon Thorkel
departed to Thorgrim, his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Sometime after this came the season of the autumn
sacrifice. Gisli would not sacrifice, but he was ready
to entertain all his friends, and invited to a great
feast. Just before this, he heard that Vestein had
arrived in Iceland in his merchant vessel, and had
put into a fiord some way off. He immediately sent
him the half-token by a servant, who was to ride as
hard as he could, and stop him from coming to
Hawkdale. The servant rode, but part of his way lay
along a lava chasm, and as ill fate would have it, he
took the way above the rift at the very time that
Vestein was riding in the opposite direction through
the bottom. So he missed him, and on reaching the
ship, learned that he had done so. He turned at
once, and rode in pursuit till his horse fell under him
just as he had caught sight of the merchant. He
ran after him shouting. Vestein turned and received
the message and the token that was to assure him the
message that accompanied it was serious.</p>

<p>“I have come more than half way,” said he. “All
the streams are running one way&mdash;towards my
brother-in-law’s vale&mdash;and I will follow them.”</p>

<p>“I warn you,” said the servant, “be on your guard.”
Vestein had to cross a river. As he was being put
across, the boatman said, “Be on your guard. You
are running into danger.” As he rode near Thorgrim’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
farm, he was seen by a serf who belonged to
Thorkel. The serf recognised him, and bade him be
on his guard. Just then, out came the serf’s wife,
Rannveig, and called to her husband to tell her who
that was in a blue cloak, and carrying a spear. The
serf went in, and Thorgrim, who was in the hall, inquired
who had passed the garth. The woman said
it was Vestein, spear in hand, wearing a blue cloak,
and seated in a rich saddle. “Pshaw,” said her husband,
“the woman can not see aright. It was a fellow
named Ogjorl, and he was wearing a borrowed cloak,
a borrowed saddle, and carrying a harpoon tipped
with horn.”</p>

<p>“One or other of you is telling lies,” said Thorgrim.
“Run, Rannveig, to Hol, Gisli’s house, and
ascertain the truth.”</p>

<p>When Vestein arrived at his brother-in-law’s, Gisli
received him, and again cautioned him. Vestein
opened his saddlebags, and produced some beautiful
Oriental stuffs interwoven with gold, and some basins,
also inlaid with gold&mdash;presents for Gisli, for his sister
Auda, and for Thorkel. Next day Gisli went to
Thorgrim’s house, carrying one of these beautiful
bowls, and offered it to his brother as a present from
Vestein; but Thorkel refused to receive it. Gisli
sighed. “I see how matters tend,” said he.</p>

<p>One night shortly after, a gale driving over the
house, tore the thatch off the hall, and the rain
poured in through the roof. Everyone woke, and
Gisli summoned all to help. The wind had abated,
but not the rain; they must go to the stackyard and
re-cover the roof as best they might. Vestein volunteered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his help, but Gisli refused it. He bade him
remain within. Vestein pulled his bed away from
the locked compartment where the water leaked
in, drew it near the fire in the open hall, and
fell asleep on it. Then softly someone entered the
hall, stole up to his bedside, and transfixed him to
the bed with a spear. Vestein cried out, and was
dead. Auda, his sister, woke, and seeing what had
taken place, call to a thrall, Witless Thord, to pull
out the weapon. Thord was too frightened to do so.
He stood quaking with open mouth. Then in came
Gisli, and, seeing what had been done, drew out the
weapon, and cast it, all bloody, into a chest. Now
according to Scandinavian ideas, not only was Gisli
solemnly bound to avenge Vestein’s death, as knit
to him by oath of brotherhood, but also by the fact of
his having withdrawn the weapon from the wound.
He at once called his sister to him, and said,
“Run to Thorgrim’s house, and bring me word what
you see there.” She went, and found the whole house
up, and armed.</p>

<p>“What news? what news?” shouted Thorgrim.
The woman told him that Vestein had been murdered.</p>

<p>“An honourable man,” said Thorgrim. “Tell
Gisli we will attend the funeral, and let the wake be
kept as Vestein deserves.”</p>

<p>Gisli prepared for the burying of his brother-in-law
according to the custom of the times. The body was
placed where a great cairn was to be heaped over it.
Then first Thorgrim stepped forward. “The death-shoes
must be made fast,” said he, and he shod the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
feet of the dead man with a pair of shoes, in which
he might walk safely the ways of Hela. “There
now,” said he, “I have bound the hell-shoes so fast
they will never come off.”</p>

<p>The summer passed, and winter drew on, then
Thorgrim resolved on a great sacrifice to Frey at the
Solstice, and on a mighty feast, to which a hundred
guests were invited. Gisli would not hold a sacrifice,
but he sent out invitations to a banquet.</p>

<p>Whilst Thorgrim and Thorkel were preparing to
receive their guests, it occurred to one of them that
Vestein had given splendid curtains to Gisli and his
sister for hanging along the sides of the hall. “I
wonder whether he would lend them?” asked Thorgrim.
“For a banquet, everyone is ready to lend
anything,” answered Thorkel. Then Thorgrim called
to him the same thrall who had endeavoured to
deceive him relative to the passing by of Vestein,
and bade him go to Gisli, and ask for the curtains.
“I don’t relish the job,” answered the man. Thorgrim
knocked him down, and bade him go as he was
bid. The man’s name was Geirmund. Geirmund
went to Hol, and found Gisli and his wife engaged in
hanging up the very curtains in preparation for their
feast. The serf proffered his request. Gisli looked
at his wife, and said, “What answer shall we make to
this?”</p>

<p>Then an idea struck him, and taking Geirmund
by the arm, he led him outside the hall, and said,
“One good turn deserves another. If I let you carry
off the curtains, will you leave the hall door ajar to-night?”
Geirmund hesitated, looked steadily at Gisli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and said, “No harm is intended against my master,
your brother, Thorkel?” “None in the least.”
“Then,” said Geirmund, “I will do it.”</p>

<p>The snow fell thick that night, and the frost was
keen. A hundred men roystered in the hall of Thorgrim.
Gisli entertained but sixty men. In the
night, when all had retired to their beds round the
hall, and were snoring, Gisli said to his wife, “Keep
up one of the fires. I must go out.” Then he drew
from the chest the weapon wherewith Vestein had
been murdered, and stepped forth into the night.
There was a little brook ran down the vale, and he
walked up the bed of the stream till he came to the
well-trodden way leading to the mansion of Thorgrim.
He went to that, and found, as he anticipated, that
the door was not locked. He entered the hall.
Three fires were burning in the midst. No one was
stirring. He stood still and listened. Then he took
the rushes up from the floor, wove them together,
and threw them as a mat on one of the fires, and
covered it. He waited a minute. No one stirred,
so he went on to the second fire, and treated it in the
same manner. The third was but smouldering, but
there was a lamp burning. He saw a young man’s
hand thrust forth from a bed to the lamp, draw it to
him, and extinguish it. Then he knew that all slept
save Geirmund, who had left the door ajar.</p>

<p>On tiptoe Gisli stepped to the closed bed-recess of
Thorgrim, and found that it was not fastened from
within. Thorgrim had not dreamed of danger, with
a hundred guests and all his servants about him.
Gisli put his hand into the bed, and touched a bosom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
It was that of his sister, the wife of Thorgrim, who
slept on the outside. The icy touch roused her, and
she said, “Husband! how cold your hand is.” “Is it
so?” answered Thorgrim, half roused, and turned in
bed. Then with one hand Gisli sharply drew down
the coverlet, and with the other drove the spear&mdash;still
stained with Vestein’s blood&mdash;through the heart
of his murderer. Thordisa woke with a cry, started
up and screamed, “Wake, and up all! my husband
has been killed!” In the dark, Gisli escaped,
and returned home by the same way he had come.</p>

<p>Next morning very early, Thorkel and the
nephews of Thorgrim came to Hol. Thorkel led
the way into the hall, and walked direct to the closed
bed of his brother. As he came to it, his quick eye
detected Gisli’s shoes frozen and covered with snow,
and he hastily kicked them under the stool lest the
nephews should see them, and conclude who had
murdered their uncle.</p>

<p>“What news?” said Gisli, rousing and sitting up
in bed.</p>

<p>“News serious and bad,” answered Thorkel.
“Thorgrim, my brother-in-law, is murdered.”</p>

<p>“Let him be buried as he deserves,” said Gisli.
“I will attend and greet him on his way.”</p>

<p>Now, at the funeral, Thorgrim was laid in a ship
that was placed on a hill-top, and all prepared to
heap a cairn over the dead man. Then Gisli heaved
a mighty stone, and flung it into the ship of the dead,
so that the beams brake, and he said, “Let none say
I cannot anchor a death-ship, for I have anchored
this that it will sail no more.” And all who heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
him remembered the words of Thorgrim when he
bound the hell-shoes on the feet of Vestein.</p>

<p>There are a good many passages in the sagas that
refer to the press-beds. In the saga of the Droplauga-sons
we read&mdash;“It was anciently the custom not
to use the <i>badstòfa</i> (the heated room); men had
instead great fires, at which they sat to heat themselves,
for at that time there was plenty of fuel in the
country. The houses were so constructed that one
hall served all purposes for banqueting and sleeping,
and the men could lie under the tables and sleep,
or each in his own room, some of the bed places
being enclosed, and in these lay the most honourable
men.”</p>

<p>In the saga of Gunnlaug with the Serpent’s
Tongue, we are told how that “One morning Gunnlaug
woke, and everyone was on foot except himself.
He lay dozing in his press-bed behind the high seat.
Then in came a dozen armed men into the hall,” etc.</p>

<p>The Droplauga-sons saga tells us how one Helgi,
Asbjorn’s son, slept with his wife in one of these
closed-in beds for fear of his mortal enemies. One
day a friend came to his house. In the evening
Helgi said to his wife, “Where have you put Ketilorm
to sleep?” “I have made him up a bed&mdash;a
good one&mdash;out on the long bench in the hall.” Then
Helgi said, “When I go to Ketilorm’s house, he
always turns out of his press-bed and gives it up to
me, so you and I must to-night lie in the hall, and
give up our close-bed to him.” They did so, and that
night the murderer came, and Helgi died through his
hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>In the saga of Egill Skallagrim’s son is a story that
shows us how that some of the closed bedchambers
contained more than one sleeping place. Egill, who
lived in Iceland, had lost his son Bödvar, who was
drowned. The grief of the old man was excessive.
He retired to his locked-up bedchamber, fastened
himself in, and, lying down, refused food. After
three days had elapsed, his wife, in serious concern,
sent for his married daughter, Thorgerthr, who, on
entering the house, said loud enough to be heard, “I
intend not to touch food till I reach the halls of
Freya. I can do naught better than follow my
father’s example.” Then she knocked at the opening
into the <i>lokhvila</i>, and called, “Father, open, I desire
to travel the same road with you.”</p>

<p>The old man let her in, and she laid herself down
on another bed in the same enclosed place.</p>

<p>After some hours had passed in silence, Egill said,
“Daughter, you are munching something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father. It is sol (<i>alga saccharina</i>). It
shortens life. Will you have some?”</p>

<p>“If it does that, I will.”</p>

<p>Then she gave him some of the seaweed. He
chewed it, and naturally both became very thirsty.</p>

<p>Presently Thorgerthr said she must taste a drop of
water. She rose, went to the door, and called for
water. Her mother brought a drinking horn. Thorgerthr
took a slender draught, and offered the horn
to her father.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said he, “that weed has parched my
throat with thirst.” So he lifted the horn with both
hands, and drained it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father,” said Thorgerthr, “we have both been
deceived; we have been drinking milk.” As she
spoke, the old man clenched his teeth in the horn,
and tore a great shred from it, then flung the vessel
wrathfully on the ground.</p>

<p>“Our scheme has failed,” said Thorgerthr, “and
we cannot now continue it. I have a better plan to
propose. Compose a death-lay on your son, Bödvar,
and I will carve it in runes on oaken staves.”</p>

<p>Then the spirit of song came on the old man, and
he composed the long Wake-song of Bödvar that
goes by the name of the Sonartorrek, and in singing
it his grief was assuaged.</p>

<p>The invasion of the Northmen, of Dane and Viking
of Norway, that made the Saxons tremble, was
an invasion of something more than marauders&mdash;it
was one of four-post beds. They did not, indeed,
bring their press beds with them in their “Long Serpents,”
but no sooner did they establish themselves
in the land&mdash;Ragnar Lodbrog’s sons in Northumbria,
and King Knut in England&mdash;than they set up their
four-posters, and made themselves both secure and
comfortable. They shut themselves in for the night,
pulled the bolt, and were safe till next morning.
We do not half understand the horrors of St. Brice’s
Day, 1002, when the Danes were massacred throughout
the dominions of Æthelred, unless we introduce
these closed beds into the picture. We must imagine
the Saxons storming the closed and bolted
boxes, and the Danes within, unable to escape, as the
axes and crowbars crashed against the oak doors
and hinges of their <i>lokhvilur</i>. They could but muffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
themselves in their feather beds, and endeavour to
burst forth when the entrance was forced.</p>

<p>The cairn, or tumulus, that covered a dead Norseman
was heaped over a sort of wooden or stone bed
made after the fashion of a <i>lokhvila</i>. In the Grettis
saga we have the story of the hero breaking into the
cairn of an old king, and he found him enclosed in a
box of boards&mdash;stout oak planks&mdash;very much as he
had been shut in every night when he retired to
sleep. The <i>kistvaens</i> of stone, oblong boxes of stones
set on end, and covered over with great slabs, to contain
the dead, are nothing other than stone four-posters.
And the modern coffin is nought else but
the wooden enclosed <i>lokhvila</i>&mdash;the Scandinavian close
bed reduced to the smallest possible dimensions.
There is no particular sense in the coffin, but it is a
reminiscence of what the beds of our Scandinavian
forefathers were, and will continue to be used long
after the four-poster is banished from our bedrooms.</p>

<p>In the Völsunga saga is a ghastly story of two men
buried alive in a kistvaen. Sigmund was the sole
surviving son of King Völsung, who had been killed
by King Siggeir of Gothland. Siggeir was married
to Signy, the sister of Sigmund. The duty to revenge
the death of Völsung lay on Sigmund, and Signy was
by no means indisposed to further this vengeance-taking.
Sigmund and his son Sinfjotli came secretly
to the hall of King Siggeir, and concealed themselves
in full harness in an outhouse behind a cask of ale.
The two boys of the king, running out, saw them
hiding there, and raised the alarm, whereupon Sigmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and Sinfjotli cut them down. King Siggeir
called together his men, and they closed round Sigmund
and his son and took them alive. Then the
King of Gothland declared he would bury them alive.
Accordingly he ordered his men to erect large
stones set on end, and to cover them over with
flat stones, and then he placed the two men,
Sigmund and Sinfjotli, in the chamber thus
formed, and heaped over them a cairn of earth and
small stones. Now, just before the last stone coverer
was placed on this living grave, Signy, the queen, flung
in a big bundle. When the cairn was raised the two
men who were entombed alive felt the bundle, and discovered
that it consisted of a stout rope wrapped round
the sword of Sigmund. That gave to them hope.
With the blade they dug at the bases of the upright
stones, and, raking out the small stuff between them,
managed to pass the rope round them, and drew
them down. By the fall of these stones a gap was
made, the top of the cairn ran in, and the two entombed
men crawled out. They at once went to the hall of
the king, heaped wood about it, and set it on fire.
As it flared, Signy came out, kissed her brother, and
his son, refused life, and went back into the flames to
die with her husband and his men.</p>

<p>The Völsunga saga is valuable, as it carries us back
to the pre-Christian condition of life in the semi-mythical
period. The Völsungs are kings of the
land of the Huns: they are not Huns themselves,
but belong to the Odin-born conquering race. The
historic Huns have the rude stone monuments attributed
to them in Hanover, Pomerania, and Mecklenburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
but they had nothing to do with their
erection. These monuments belong to a far earlier
race.</p>

<p>When King Harold Fairhair converted Norway
into a single monarchy, many of the old chiefs fled
the land rather than submit; but one, Herlaugi, in
Naumudal, went alive with twelve of his men into a
cairn that contained a kist, and had it closed upon him.</p>

<p>In the saga of Egil and Asmund is a queer story of
two men who swore brotherhood with each other,
that he who survived the other should spend three
nights in the cairn with his dead brother, “and then
depart <i>if he liked</i>.” The saga goes on to tell how
that one of these, Aran, was slain, then his fellow, Asmund,
“threw up a cairn, and placed by the dead man
his horse, with saddle and bridle, and all his harness
and his banner, his hawk, also, and his hound; Aran
sat in the high stool in full armour. Then Asmund
had his chair brought into the cairn and sat there,
and the cairn was closed on them. In the first night
Aran rose from his stool and killed hawk and hound,
and ate them both. In the second night Aran stood
up and slew his horse, and tore it in pieces, rending it
with his teeth, and he ate the horse, the blood running
over his jaws. And he invited Asmund to eat with
him. The third night Asmund felt heavy with sleep,
and he snoozed off, and was not aware before the
dead man had gripped him by both ears and had
torn them off his head. Asmund then drew his
sword, hewed off the head of Aran, took fire, and
burned him to ashes. Then he went to the rope and
was drawn up, and the cairn was closed. But Asmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
carried away with him all the treasure it contained.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Norsemen were buried seated in their chairs
or in their boats, but the builders of the megalithic
monuments were interred lying on their sides, with
their hands folded, as though in sleep. Their great
dolmens and covered avenues were family cemeteries.
The slab at the east end was movable, so as to allow
of admission into the tomb on each fresh death in
the family. A hole in the stone at the foot is very
usual. Of that elsewhere. The latest interments
in a dolmen are always nearest the opening; sometimes
the more ancient dead have been removed
farther back in the monument to make room for the
new-comers. There is an allusion in Snorn’s Heimskringla
to these holes in the kists containing the
dead: “Freyr fell sick and his men raised a great
mound, in which they placed a door with three holes
in it. Now when Freyr was dead they conveyed him
secretly into the mound, but told the Swedes he was
alive; and they kept watch over him for three years.
They brought all the taxes into the mound&mdash;through
one hole they thrust in the gold, through another
they put in the silver, and through the third the
copper money that was paid.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the Scandinavians followed to
some extent the usage of the race that preceded them,
and used their megalithic monuments, much as we
know that tumuli were employed for later interments,
and by races different from that which raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tumuli. That the idea of sleep was connected with
death in many cases of burials, is certain, from the
position given to the corpse, the hands are folded
and the knees drawn up.</p>

<p>We cannot say for certain that the dolmens, as the
French call the monuments which we term cromlechs,
were reproductions in stone of the closed beds
of the men of the polished-stone age, but it is probable.
The great family dolmens were cemeterial
big Beds of Ware to accommodate a number, and the
small kistvaens were single beds for old bachelors.
Some of the largest dolmens contain as many as forty
sleepers. Under Brown Willy, the highest point of
the Cornish moors, is one long kistvaen, and beside
it a tiny one for a baby&mdash;the mother’s bed and the
cradle, side by side, for the long night of death.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 24.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">DOLMEN, GABAUDET, NEAR GRAMAT. DEP. DE LOT.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been supposed that the cromlechs, or dolmens,
and the kistvaens, represent the ancient dwellings
of the neolithic men. I do not think so. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
position of the bodies shows that they were intended,
not as dwellings, but as beds. If they resembled anything
used in life, it was the bed-compartments in the
huts, not the huts themselves. These bed-compartments
were backed, walled, and roofed with stone.</p>

<p>I was once offered in Antwerp a very beautifully
carved oak bed; it was but an oblong box, with an
opening on one side only, which could be closed with
a curtain, and very much like a berth in an old-fashioned
steam-packet.</p>

<p>The reader will remember the graphic description,
in “Wuthering Heights,” of a very similar close-bed of
boards as used in Yorkshire. That Yorkshire bed
was a lineal descendant from the <i>lokhvila</i> of the
Scandinavian colonists of Northumbria.</p>

<p>When danger of assassination in bed ceased, men
began to sleep easier, breathe freer, and dispensed
with the door and its bolts. They shut themselves in
with curtains instead; and as there were practical inconveniences
in making beds, where the bed maker
could not go round to the wall side, cautiously and
with hesitation suffered the bed to be pulled out, so that
it might stand free on all sides save the head. Then
head and top alone remained of board, two sides and
foot were left open, or partially open; they could be
closed with curtains, and the sleeper could and did convert
his bed into a sort of box when he retired to rest.</p>

<p>So beds remained throughout the Middle Ages and
to last century. Some ancient beds had gabled
roofs over them, and many remained fixed in on all
sides save one. But at the same time there was the
truckle-bed for the servant; even the iron bedstead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
without tester, precisely like those turned out by every
ironmonger. Viollet le Duc gives an engraving of
one such in his “Dictionnaire du Mobilier Français,”
from a miniature of the tenth century. He gives also
a representation of an iron bed thrust under a roof-like
covering, with curtains, and ventilating windows,
on which Solomon is shown asleep, from a MS. of the
twelfth century. It would almost seem that in the
Middle Ages a contest raged between the four-poster
and the bed without tester, and in the MS. from
which the illustration just mentioned is taken the
wisdom of Solomon is represented as combining both
fashions.</p>

<p>Anyone who has taken lodgings in Germany is
aware of the alcove-bed; the curtains are let fall that
conceal a recess, and, lo! the chamber has ceased to
be a bedroom and has become a reception-room. This
is another adaptation of the Northern conception of a
bed. In the London houses of Gower Street, and
of streets built at the same period, the same
idea is carried out in a somewhat pretentious form.
In front, looking out on the street, is the sitting-room,
opposite the window are folding doors, and behind
them the bedroom. The little back room behind
these doors is the <i>lokhvila</i> somewhat enlarged.</p>

<p>(<i>By kind permission of “The Daily Graphic.”</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, the two ideas of bed, the open and the
closed, go back a long way. I have mentioned in the
preceding article the exploration of an ancient settlement&mdash;date
early but unfixed&mdash;on the Cornish moors.
One hut had in it both types of bed. We saw in the
article on “Ovens” how that in the Hebrides, in the
bee-hive huts to this day, a portion of the floor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
marked off by curb stones, and this portion is converted
into a bed at night and a seat by day. So was
it in one of the stone huts on Trewortha Marsh. A
set of granite blocks in a curve parted one portion of
the earth floor from the rest. That was the bed
according to the Keltic ideal. But, and this was
curious, in the depth of the wall at the farther end of
the hut, was a hole seven feet deep in the thickness
of the wall, with a great slab of granite at the bottom
smoothed to serve as mattress. It was about 2 feet 3
inches wide at the foot, as much at the head, but
widened to 3 feet 4 inches in the middle. The height
above the floor was 4 inches. It adjoined the oven&mdash;it
was a bed according to Scandinavian ideas, with this
sole difference, that access to it was obtained at the
foot, which alone was open, and not at the side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>Do those two types of bed in one hovel 10 feet
square signify that men of two nationalities occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it, each with his bed-ideal, which he would not abandon?
We cannot say; probably it means no more
than this, the confluence of two streams of tradition.</p>

<p>The wooden coffin is neither more nor less than the
wooden four-poster or rather closed bed reduced to
the smallest possible dimensions. Among the megalithic
people the stone grave was gradually reduced
in dimensions from the mighty dolmen to the small
kistvaen. The great tumulus or cairn is now represented
by the little green mound in the churchyard,
and the menhir or long stone, rude and uninscribed, has
its modern counterpart much altered in the headstone.
The enclosed box-like stone tombs that were erected
during last century were survivals of the kistvaen, as
were also the sarcophagi of the ancients. The wooden
coffin is but in small the wooden chamber of the dead
of our Norse ancestors, which was itself but a reproduction
of the closed bedchamber.</p>

<p>For myself, when I think how much that is great
and vigorous and noble comes to us through our Norse
ancestry, I regret that by the abandonment of the
four-poster we are casting aside one of its most
cherished traditions, and yet there remains matter of
consolation in the thought that, for the last sleep of
all, we revert to the fashion of bed <i>a la Scandinave</i>.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, the rats be a rampagin’ in the lumber-room
as makes the blood curl!”</p>

<p>For fifty years I had never been into that lumber-room.
It is situated up a steep flight of steps in the
back kitchen, and had once been inhabited by a
button-boy. Here is an extract from my grandmother’s
account-book for the year 1803:&mdash;</p>

<table class="table1" summary="">

<p class="uni">Verily prices have risen since 1803.</p>

<p>However, to return to the four-pounder. He inhabited
this room some ninety years ago: then it was
abandoned, finally locked up, and the key lost. About
fifty years ago, as a boy, I did explore the place,
through the window, after nests. My grandfather
died. Then my father succeeded, and the room
remained unopened during his reign. My father
died, and I succeeded to the old house. I had been
in it some years, when the other day the kitchen-maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
complained that the rats in this lumber-room
over the back kitchen made her blood “curl,”
by which she meant, presumably, “curdle;” till then
I had never thought of an exploration.</p>

<p>To abate the nuisance, however, I broke open
the door and entered the long-abandoned room.
Since the four-pounder had occupied it, for some
years that room must have been employed as a
place for lumber, because it proved to contain a
quantity of old, disused articles in iron and tin, and
amongst these were two stands for rushlights, a
tinder-box, and a glass phosphorus bottle.</p>

<p>Such a find carried one back, as few other things
could, to early days, and showed one the enormous
advance we have made in this century in the comforts
of life.</p>

<p>Some of us can remember the rushlight, a few the
phosphorus bottle, fewer the tinder-box.</p>

<p>Of the rushlights I found, one was familiar to me;
the other, probably an earlier type, I had never seen.
The former consisted of a cylinder of sheet-iron, perforated
with round holes, the cylinder about two feet
high. This contained the rushlight. At the bottom
was a basin for a little water, that the sparks, as they
fell, might be extinguished.</p>

<p>Well do I recall such rushlight lamps! One always
burned at night in my father’s bedroom, and when I
was ill I was accommodated with one as well. The
feeble, flickering light issued through the perforations
and capered in fantastic forms over the walls and
furniture.</p>

<p>The other rushlight lamp was of a different construction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
It consisted of a long spiral of iron wire,
and was probably discarded for the newer and safer
invention of the lamp with perforated holes. The
spiral coil would prevent the lanky rushlight from
falling over and out of the lamp, but not the red-hot
dock from spluttering on to the carpet or boards of
the floor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i_b_112.png" width="339" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 27.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">RUSHLIGHT-HOLDERS.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>There was in use, formerly, in England another
sort of rushlight-holder. It consisted of an iron rod
planted in a socket of
wood that stood on the
floor. To this rod, which
was round, was affixed a
sliding contrivance that
upheld a socket for the
rushlight, which might
be raised or lowered as
suited convenience. Connected
with the holder
was the snuffer. The
candle had to be taken
<i>out</i> of its socket to have its wick pinched between
the upright unremovable snuffers. Conceive the
inconvenience! The drip of tallow about fingers
and floor! We have indeed advanced since such
candle-holders were in use. They stood about four
feet from the floor.</p>

<p>It was necessary in former times for a light to be
kept burning all night in one room, for to strike a
light was a long and laborious operation. There
were little silver boxes that contained amadou, the
spongy texture of a puff-ball, and some matches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
dipped in sulphur, also a flint. One side of the box
was armed with a steel. In striking a light the
holder put the amadou in position to receive the
sparks from the steel as he struck the flint, then,
when the amadou glowed, he touched it with the
brimstone end of the match and ignited that&mdash;a matter
of five to ten minutes. Why, a burglar could
clear off with the plate before the roused master of
the house could strike a light and kindle his candle
to look for him.</p>

<p>The tinder-box employed commonly in kitchens
and cottages was a different application of the same
principle. It consisted of a circular tin or iron box,
with the socket for a candle soldered on to the top.
This box contained a removable bottom. When
opened it displayed a steel and a lump of flint.
These were taken out and the removable bottom
lifted up, when below was disclosed a mass of black
tinder. The manufacture of this tinder was one of
the accomplishments of our forefathers, or rather
foremothers. It was made of linen rag burned in a
close vessel, completely charred, without being set on
fire, and the manufacture of tinder had to take place
weekly, and consumed a considerable amount of linen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning early, before dawn, the first sounds
heard in a small house were the click, click, click of
the kitchen-maid, striking flint and steel over the tinder
in the box. When the tinder was ignited, the maid
blew upon it till it glowed sufficiently to enable her to
kindle a match made of a bit of stick dipped in brimstone.
The cover was then returned to the box, and
the weight of the flint and steel pressing it down
extinguished the sparks in the carbon. The operation
was not, however, always successful; the tinder
or the matches might be damp, the flint blunt, and the
steel worn; or, on a cold, dark morning, the operator
would not infrequently strike her knuckles instead
of the steel; a match, too, might be often long in
kindling, and it was not pleasant to keep blowing
into the tinder-box, and on pausing a moment to
take breath, to inhale sulphurous acid gas, and a
peculiar odour which the tinder-box always exhaled.</p>

A TINDERBOX.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Here is a curious passage from an article on “The
Production of Fire,” in the <i>Penny Magazine</i> for 26th
July, 1834:&mdash;“The flint and steel, with the tinder
and match of some kind or other, have long been the
instruments of getting a light in the civilised world....
Within the present century the aid of chemistry
has been called in, ... and instantaneous
lights have become quite common, under the various
names of Promethians, Lucifers, etc., although, from
its superior cheapness, <i>the tinder-box will probably
always keep its place in domestic use</i>.” This article
was published in the very year in which I was born,
and now it is extremely difficult to obtain an old
tinder-box. I have sought in the cottages and farmhouses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in my own parish and those adjoining, and
have been unsuccessful in discovering more than one.
A generation has grown up that has never even
heard of the tinder-box.</p>

<p>In or about 1673 phosphorus was discovered, and
its easy ignition by mere friction made known, and
this opened the prospect of more easy means of obtaining
a light. But phosphorus was costly, and a
century and a half elapsed before the phosphorus
match came into use. Phosphoric tapers were employed;
these were small wax tapers, the wicks
of which were coated with phosphorus; they were
enclosed in glass tubes hermetically sealed, and when
a light was required, one end of the tube was removed
with a file, when the taper became ignited by
exposure to the air.</p>

<p>The plan was, however, clumsy, besides being
dangerous and costly, and never took hold of public
estimation. The next attempt was to put a piece of
phosphorus into a small phial, and dissolve it at a
moderate heat, then keep the phial corked. The
bottle was about the size of one of smelling salts, and
was kept at the head of the bed. When a light was
required, the glass stopper was removed, and a match
coated with sulphur was dipped into it, and worked
about till a flame was produced, when the match was
withdrawn, and the phial hastily corked. Another
method was to rub the match, after dipping it in the
bottle, against a piece of cork or soft wood, the friction
more certainly or less dangerously promoting the
combination of the sulphur and phosphorus, and the
consequent production of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of kindling a match was by means
of Homberg’s phosphorus, or fire-bearer. It was a
black powder compound of flour, sugar, and alum,
which took fire on exposure to the air. But it never
came into general use. It remained in the hands of
the curious. None of these inventions displaced the
old tinder-box, which maintained itself to within the
memory of many of us who are over fifty years.</p>

<p>Of all the ingenious attempts to get rid of the tinder-box,
the oxymuriate matches were the most successful.
From them our present lucifers are lineally
descended. The oxymuriate matches were composed
of chlorate of potash and sugar coating a strip of
wood. The match was dipped into a bottle containing
a piece of asbestos soaked in oil of vitriol. The
bottle and a number of these matches, with tipped
ends downwards, were put into a neat little case, and
this was called the “phosphorus box.” On their first
introduction, these boxes sold as high as 15s. each;
they gradually fell to 10s., then 5s., but never went
below half-a-crown. But they were not altogether
successful. The oil of vitriol lost its force after a
while, owing to the readiness with which it absorbed
moisture from the air, and then the matches smouldered
instead of bursting into flame.</p>

<p>The next advance was the lucifer-match, with
phosphorus and sulphur combined at the end. But
this was dangerous, and frightful accidents attended
the manufacture. I spent some winters at Pau, in the
south of France, and near our house were the cottages
of poor people who worked at match-making.
The pans of melted phosphorus into which the heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the matches were dipped would explode suddenly,
and scatter their flaming contents over the match-girls.
My mother, as an angel of goodness, was wont
to visit and minister to many and many a poor little
burnt girl, who had thus been set fire to.</p>

<p>But the phosphorus match-making had another
objection to it, besides the accidents produced in the
melting of phosphorus. It brought on a frightful
disease in the jaw. The bone was attacked, and
rotted away. In the “Dublin Quarterly Journal of
Medical Science” for 1852, the nature of the disease
is thus described:&mdash;“An affection ensues which
is so insidious in its nature that it is at first supposed
to be common toothache, and a most serious
disease of the jaw is produced before the patient
is aware of his condition. The disease gradually
creeps on until the sufferer becomes a miserable and
loathsome object, spending the best period of his
life in the wards of a public hospital. Many
patients have died of the disease; many unable
to open their jaws have lingered with carious
and necrosed bones; others have suffered dreadful
mutilations from surgical operations, considering
themselves happy to escape with the loss of the
greater portion of the lower jaw. In the Museum
of the Manchester Infirmary is the lower jaw of a
young woman who is now at work. Her face is
much disfigured by the loss of her chin, and, on looking
into her mouth, the root of the tongue is seen
connected with her under lip, the space formerly
occupied by the jaw being obliterated by the contraction
of the cheek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in the advance of civilisation, great agonies
have been gone through. Our present conveniences
have been purchased at the cost of throes and tears
in the past. We should not forget that civilisation
has had its martyrs.</p>

<p>Lastly came the match made without phosphorus.
When we think of the toil and trouble that the lighting
of a fire occasioned, we can understand what
store was set on never letting a fire on the hearth go
out. An old woman on Dartmoor, recently dead,
boasted on her death-bed: “I be sure I’se goin’ to
glory; for sixty-three years have I been married,
and never in all them years once let the hearth-fire go
out.” But there the fire was of peat, which will
smoulder on untouched for many hours.</p>

<p>There was a stage of civilisation before the tinder-box
came in, and that was a stage when fire had to
be kept in, and if it went out, borrowed from a
neighbour. In the earliest age, fire was obtained by
friction; a piece of wood with a hole in it was placed
on the ground between the feet. Then a man held a
piece shaped like the letter T in his hands, and
rapidly twirled this about, with the long end inserted
in the hole of the piece he held between his feet, till
by friction the upright was ignited. The pieces of
wood must be very dry, and requisite dryness was
not easily procurable in our moist northern climes,
consequently the labour of kindling a flame was proportionately
great. Sometimes a wheel was employed,
and the axle turned in that to produce a
flame. It has been thought that the <i>fylfot</i> <img class="inline" src="images/i_b_118.png" width="25" height="25" alt="fylfot" />, the
crook-legged cross found on so many monuments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
antiquity, the <i>Svastika</i> of India, represents an
instrument for the production of fire by friction.
But owing to the great difficulty in producing
fire by this means, the greatest possible care
was taken of the household fire, lest it should
become extinguished. This originated the worship
of Vesta. The flame once procured was
guarded against extinction in some central spot by
the unmarried women of the house, and when villages
and towns were formed, a central circular hut was
erected in which a common fire was maintained, and
watched continuously. From this central hearth all
the hearths of the settlement were supplied. Ovid tells
us that the first temple of Vesta at Rome was constructed
of wattled walls, and roofed with thatch like
the primitive huts of the inhabitants. It was little
other than a circular, covered fireplace, and was
tended by the unmarried girls of the infant community.
It served as the public hearth of Rome, and
on it glowed, unextinguished throughout the year,
the sacred fire, which was supposed to have been
brought from Troy, and the continuance of which
was thought to be linked with the fortunes of the
city. The name Vesta is believed to be derived from
the same root as the Sanscrit <i>vas</i>, which means “to
dwell, to inhabit,” and shows that she was the goddess
of home, and home had the hearth as its focus.
A town, a state, is but a large family, and what the
domestic hearth was to the house, that the temple of
the perpetual fire became to the city. Every town
had its Vesta, or common hearth, and the colonies
derived their fire from the mother hearth. Should a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
vestal maiden allow the sacred fire to become extinguished,
she was beaten by the Grand Pontiff till her
blood flowed, and the new fire was solemnly rekindled
by rubbing together dry wood, or by focussing the
sun’s rays. It might not be borrowed from a strange
place. The circular form and domed roof of the
Temples of Vesta were survivals of the prehistoric
huts of the aborigines.</p>

<p>Among the legends of the early Celtic saints nothing
is more common than the story of the saint being
sent to borrow fire, and carrying it in his lap without
the fire injuring his garment.</p>

<p>In Ireland, before St. Patrick introduced Christianity,
there was a temple at Tara where fire burned
ever, and was on no account suffered to go out.</p>

<p>When Christianity became dominant, it was necessary
to dissociate the ideas of the people from the
central fire as mixed up with the old gods; at the
same time some central fire was an absolute need.
Accordingly the Church was converted into the sacred
depository of the perpetual fire, and a lamp was kept
in it ever burning, not only
that the candles might be
ignited from it for the services,
without recourse had
to friction or tinder flint and
steel, but also that the parish,
the village, the town, might
obtain thence their fire.</p>

<p>There exist still a few&mdash;a
very few&mdash;contrivances
for this perpetual fire in our churches; they go by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the name of cresset-stones. The earliest I know is
not in England, but is in the atrium outside the remarkable
church of St. Ambrogio at Milan. It is
a block of white marble on a moulded base, it is now
broken, but banded together with iron. It stands 3
feet 10 inches high, and is 2 feet 6 inches in
diameter at top. It consists of a flat surface in
which are depressed nine
cuplike hollows. These
were originally filled
with oil, and wicks were
placed in them and ignited.
In England one
is still <i>in situ</i>, in the
church of Lewannick, in
Cornwall. There it is
not far from the door.
It consists of a circular
block containing on its
flat upper surface, which is twenty-two inches across,
seven cuplike hollows, four and a half inches deep.
The stone stands on a rudely moulded base, octagonal,
and is in all about 2 feet 6 inches high.
In Furness Abbey, among the ruins, has been found
another, with five cups in it; at Calder Abbey another,
with sixteen such cups for oil and wicks. At
York is another with six such fire-cups, and at Stockholm
another with the same number, in a square
stone table. At Wool Church, Dorset, is again
another example built into the south wall of a small
chapel on the north side of the chancel. It is a block
of Purbeck marble, and has in the top five cup-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cavities quite blackened with the oil and smoke. In
some of the examples there are traces of a metal pin
around which the wick was twisted.</p>

<p>In addition to these, in several churches are to be
found lamp-niches. Some have chimneys or flues,
which pass upwards, in some cases passing into the
chimneys of fireplaces. Others have conical hollows
in the heads or roofs, in order to catch the soot, and
prevent it passing out into the church.</p>

<p>Now, although these lamps and cressets had their
religious signification, yet this religious signification
was an afterthought. The origin of them lay in the
necessity of there being in every place a central light,
from which light could at any time be borrowed;
and the reason why this central light was put in the
church was to dissociate it from the heathen ideas
attached formerly to it. As it was, the good people
of the Middle Ages were not quite satisfied with the
central church fire, and they had recourse in times of
emergency to others&mdash;and as the Church deemed
them&mdash;unholy fires. When a plague and murrain
appeared among cattle, then they lighted need-fires,
from two pieces of dry wood, and drove the cattle
between the flames, believing that this new flame was
wholesome to the purging away of the disease. For
kindling the need-fires the employment of flint and
steel was forbidden. The fire was only efficacious
when extracted in prehistoric fashion, out of wood.
The lighting of these need-fires was forbidden by the
Church in the eighth century. What shows that this
need-fire was distinctly heathen is that in the Church
new fire was obtained at Easter annually by striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
flint and steel together. It was supposed that the
old fire in a twelvemonth had got exhausted, or
perhaps that all light expired with Christ, and that
new fire must be obtained. Accordingly the priest
solemnly struck new fire out of flint and steel. But
fire from flint and steel was a novelty; and the
people, Pagan at heart, had no confidence in it, and in
time of adversity went back to the need-fire kindled
in the time-honoured way from wood by friction, before
this new-fangled way of drawing it out of stone
and iron was invented.</p>

<p>The curious festival of the Car of Fire observed on
Easter Eve every year at Florence carries us back to
a remote period when fire was a sacred and mysterious
thing. As is well known, in the Eastern
Church, also in the Roman Catholic Church, all
fires are extinguished before Easter; and in the
Cathedral, the Bishop, on Easter morning, strikes
new fire, blesses it, and all the hearths in the
city receive the new fire from this blessed spark. It is
vulgarly supposed that the old fire has got worn out,
and has lost its full vigour by use throughout the
year, and that the new fire is full of restless and
youthful energy. There can be little doubt that this
idea goes back to a remote and Pagan time, and the
Church accepted what was a common custom, and
gave it, or tried to give it, a new and Christian idea,
connecting it with the resurrection of Him who is the
Light of the World. The same custom of striking
and blessing new fire exists in many parts of the
West as well as the East, and is sanctioned by the
Roman Church. But nowhere does this ancient usage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
assume so quaint and picturesque a form as at Florence.
There, however, the primitive significance is
completely forgotten, and the people have endeavoured
to explain the ceremony which I will now
describe in various mutually contradictory ways.</p>

<p>On Easter Eve, four magnificent white oxen, their
huge horns wreathed with flowers, and with garlands
about them, as though they were being conveyed to
sacrifice, draw a huge car, painted black, some twenty-five
feet high, pyramidal in shape, and crowned with
a mural coronet, into the piazza before the west doors
of the white marble cathedral. The car is itself
wreathed with flowers to its highest pinnacle, and
with the flowers various fireworks are interspersed.
As soon as this great trophy is in place, and
the oxen unyoked, the west doors of the cathedral
are thrown open, and a rope is strained
from the top of the car to a pillar that is erected
in front of the high altar, a distance of some
two hundred yards. On this cord is seen perched a
white dove, composed of some white substance, probably
plaster. For two hours before the event of the
day takes place the great piazza and the nave of the
vast cathedral are crowded. Villagers from all the
country round have arrived; but there are also present
plenty of townsfolk, and strangers from foreign
lands. At half-past eleven, the archbishop and all
his clergy come in procession down the body of the
church, pass out of the west doors, and make the
circuit of the cathedral. Before twelve o’clock strikes
they are again in their places in the choir. At the
stroke of noon the newly-blessed fire is applied to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
train of gunpowder at the foot of the pillar. In
another moment the pigeon skims down the nave,
pouring out a shower of fire, sweeps out of the west
door of the cathedral, reaches the trophy in the
square, sets fire to a fusee there, then turns and flies
back along the rope, still discharging a rain of fire,
till it has reached its pillar before the altar, and there
is still.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/i_b_125.png" width="257" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 32.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE CARRO, FLORENCE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>But in the meantime the fusee at the car has set
fire to various squibs
and petards and
crackers there, and
the whole structure
is speedily enveloped
in fire and smoke,
from which explosions
issue every few
moments. As soon
as the last firework
has expired, the
white oxen are again
yoked to the car, and
it is drawn away.</p>

<p>The flight of the
dove is watched by
the peasants with
breathless anxiety,
for the course it takes indicates, in their idea, the
sort of weather that is likely to ensue during the
year. If the bird moves slowly, halts, then goes on
again, halts, and is sluggish in its flight, they conclude
the year will be tempestuous and the harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bad. If the dove skims along to the car and back
without a hitch, they calculate on a splendid summer
and autumn, on a rich yield of corn, and overflowing
presses of grapes.</p>

<p>And now for the legends whereby the people explain
this curious custom. According to one, a certain
Florentine named Pazzino went to Jerusalem in
the twelfth century, kindled a torch there at the Holy
Sepulchre on Easter Eve, and resolved to bring this
same sacred fire with him back to Florence. But as
he rode along, the wind blew in his face and well-nigh
extinguished his torch, so he sat his steed with
his face to the tail, screening the flame with his body,
and so rode all the way home! The people along
his route, seeing him thus ride reversed, shouted out,
“Pazzi! Pazzi!” (“O fool! fool!”) and that name of
“fool” he and his family assumed; and the family is
still represented in Florence.</p>

<p>There is another version of the story; one Pazzino,
seeing the Holy Sepulchre in the hands of the
infidels, broke off as much of it as he could carry to
convey home to his dear Florence. As he was pursued
by the Saracens, he reversed the shoes of his horse
to avoid being tracked. On reaching Florence it was
resolved that the new Easter fire should always be
kindled on the stone of the Holy Sepulchre he had
brought home. In honour of his achievement, moreover,
the municipality ordered that the ceremony of
the Car of Fire and the fiery dove should be maintained
every year. For many centuries the expenses
were borne by the Pazzi family; but of late years
they have been relieved of these by the municipality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The third version of the story is, that Pazzino was
a knight with Godfrey de Bouillon in the first Crusade,
and that he was the first of the besiegers to mount the
walls and plant on them the banner of the cross.
Moreover, he sent the tidings of the recovery of the
Holy Sepulchre home to Florence by a carrier-pigeon,
and thus the news reached Florence long before it
could have arrived in any other way.</p>

<p>Such are the principal legends connected with this
curious ceremony, and we are constrained to say that
we believe that one is as fabulous as another. The
explanation of the custom is really this.</p>

<p>The rite of striking the new fire was observed at
Florence, as elsewhere, from an early date, but the
<i>communication</i> of the new fire from the newly-ignited
candle was both a long affair, and occasioned noise,
struggle and inconvenience. Accordingly&mdash;partly to
save the church from being the scene of an unseemly
scramble, and partly to make the communication of
the fire an easy matter to a large number of persons at
once&mdash;an ingenious contrivance was made, whereby a
dove should carry the flame from the choir of the
cathedral, above the reach of the people, who therefore
could not scuffle and scramble for it, to the market-place
outside, where it ignited a bonfire, to which all the
people could apply their candles and torches. After
a while the real intention was forgotten, and the bonfire
was converted into a great exhibition of fireworks
in the daytime.</p>

<p>The whole ceremony has a somewhat childish
character, but then it dates back to a period when
all men were children; and it serves, if rightly understood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to link us with the past, and enables us to
measure the distance we have trodden since those
ages when fire was one of the most difficult things to
be re-acquired, if once lost, and the preservation of
fire and the striking of fire were matters of extreme
importance, and were after a while reserved to a
sacred class.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<h2 id="VI">VI.<br />
<span class="old">Umbrellas.</span></h2>


<p>Some years ago I happened to be at that most picturesque
old city of Würzburg on a showery May
market-day. The window of my hotel commanded
the square. The moment that the first sprinkle came
over the busy scene of market women and chafferers,
the whole square suddenly flowered like a vast garden.
Every woman at her stall expanded an enormous
umbrella, and these umbrellas were of every
dye&mdash;crimson, blue, green, chocolate, and&mdash;yes, there
was even one of marigold yellow, under which the
huckstress crouched as beneath a mighty inverted
eschscholtzia. Nor were these umbrellas all <i>selfs</i>, as
horticulturists describe monotoned pansies; for some
were surrounded with a perfect rainbow of coloured
lines as a border; and others were wreathed about
with a pattern of many-hued flowers. Presently, out
came the May sun, and, <i>presto</i>, every umbrella was
closed and folded and laid aside: the flower garden
had resolved itself into a swarm of busy marketers.</p>

<p>On reaching Innsbruck, I lighted on an umbrella-maker’s
shop under one of the arcades near the
Golden Roof of Frederick with the Empty Pockets.
I saw suspended before the vault in which the man
dwelt or did business, umbrellas the exact reproductions
of what I had seen at Würzburg&mdash;red, green,
brown, blue, even white&mdash;lined with pink, like mushrooms:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and for the sum of about fifteen shillings I became
the happy possessor of one of these articles, which
I proceed to describe. The covering was of a brilliant
red, and imprinted round it was a wreath of flowers
and foliage, white, yellow, blue, and green; around
the ferule also was a smaller wreath similar in colour
and character. This cover was stretched on canes,
such canes as are well known in schools; and the
canes were distended by twisted brass strainers, rising
out of a sliding tube of elaborately hammered
brass, through which passed the stick of the umbrella.
The whole, when expanded, measured nearly five feet,
and was not extraordinarily heavy, nothing like the
weight of a gig-umbrella. Walking under it was like
walking about in a tent, taking the tent with one;
and walking under it in the rain filled one with sanguine
hopes that the day was about to mend, so surrounded
was one with a warm and cheerful glow.
On a hot climb over a pass, when I spread this shelter
above my head against the sun, I felt that I must
appear to the shepherds on the high pastures like a
migratory Alpine rose.</p>

<p>I met with no inconvenience whatever from my
umbrella till I reached Heidelberg on my way home,
and innocently walked with it under my arm in the
Castle gardens on Sunday afternoon. Then I found
that it provoked attention and excited astonishment.
Such an umbrella had its social level, and that level
was the market-place, not the Castle gardens; it was
sufferable as spread over an old woman vending
<i>sauerkraut</i>, but not as carried furled in the hand of a
respectably dressed gentleman. So much comment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
did my umbrella occasion that it annoyed me, spoiled
the pleasure of my walk, and I accepted the offer of
a friend to relieve me of it. He took my umbrella
and thrust it up his back under his coat, and with
crossed arms to the rear, hugged it to his spine. But
even so it was not to escape observation, for the
black handle, crooked, appeared below his coat, a
fact to which I was aroused as I dropped behind
my friend, by the exclamations of a nursemaid:
“<i>Ach Tausend!</i> the Herr has a curly tail!” and then
of a Professor, who, beckoning some students to him,
said: “Let us catch him&mdash;the Missing Link, <i>homo
caudatus</i>.”</p>

<p>On reaching England, the great scarlet-crimson (it
was neither exactly one nor exactly the other) umbrella
was consigned to the stand in the hall. Those
were not the days when ladies spread red parasols
above their bonnets, and had sunshades to match
their gowns: in those days all parasols were brown
or black; consequently the innovation of a red umbrella
would be too great, too startling for me to attempt.
But one morning&mdash;it was that on which the
Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh made their entry
into London after their marriage&mdash;I started early to
drive to the station and go to town and join the
sightseers. It may be in the recollection of those
who were out that day that snow fell. Early in the
morning in the country there was a good deal of
snow, so much, that I thought I might safely take
my Tyrolese umbrella to cover me in my gig. I
intended to furl it before I reached the station and
such places where men do congregate. It was remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that although the snow spoiled the picturesque
effect of the procession in Regent’s Street
by making the redcoats draw on their overcoats, it
induced me to unfurl my marvellous red travelling
tent&mdash;which is an instance, may be, of the compensation
there is in nature.</p>

<p>As I drove along, I chanced on an umbrella-maker,
trudging through the snow, head down, with
a bundle of his manufacture under his arm. He
neither saw nor heard the dogcart till it was close on
him, when the driver shouted to him to stand aside.
Then he started back, looked up, and I saw the
change of expression in the man’s face, as his eyes
took in the apparition above him of the expanded
red umbrella, flower-wreathed and brass-mounted.
The face had been inanimate; then, a wild enthusiasm
or astonishment kindled it, and down into the snow at
his feet fell the umbrellas he was carrying. I drove
on, but looked back at intervals, and as long as he
was in sight, I saw him standing in the road,
with eyes and mouth open, hands expanded and
every finger distended, and his umbrellas, uncollected,
scattered about him in the snow.</p>

<p>These reminiscences of my remarkable umbrella
lead me to say something of umbrellas in general.</p>

<p>I hardly think that the true origin, development,
and, shall I say, degradation of the umbrella, is generally
known. Yet it deserves to be known, for it
supplies a graphic and striking condensation of vast
social changes.</p>

<p>The umbrella comes to us from the East, from
nations living under a burning sun, to whom shade is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
therefore agreeable. We can understand how the
giving of shade came easily to be regarded as a symbol
of majesty. In the apocryphal book of Baruch
occurs the passage, “We shall live under the shadow
of Nebucodonosor, king of Babylon, and under the
shadow of Balthasar, his son.” Primitively, kings
gave audience and delivered judgment seated under
trees, not only because of the comfort of the shade,
but also because of the symbolism. So, when Ethelbert,
King of Kent, received St. Augustine, he was
seated under an oak; and Wagner is quite right
when, in the opening scene in <i>Lohengrin</i>, he makes
King Pepin hold his court enthroned under a tree.</p>

<p>But when sovereigns took to receiving suitors and
dispensing justice indoors, they transferred with
them to within the symbol of the tree. Phylarchus,
in describing the luxury of Alexander, says that the
Persian kings gave audience under plane trees or
vines made of gold and hung with emeralds, but that
the magnificence of the throne of Alexander surpassed
theirs. Curtius relates how the kings of India had
golden vines erected in their judgment halls so as
to overspread their thrones. The throne of Cyrus was
over-canopied by a golden vine of seven branches.
Firdusi describes a similar throne-tree at the festival
given by Kai Khosru:</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“A tree was erected, many-branched,</div>
<div class="verse">Bending over the throne with its head:</div>
<div class="verse">Of silver the trunk, but the branches of gold;</div>
<div class="verse">The buds and the blossoms were rubies;</div>
<div class="verse">The fruit was of sapphire and cornelian stone;</div>
<div class="verse">And the foliage all was of emerald.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>From the East, the idea or fashion was transplanted
to Byzantium, and the emperors there had similar
trees erected above their thrones overshadowing them.
William of Rubruquis describes a great silver tree in
the Palace of the Khan of the Tartars, in 1253, of
which leaves and fruit, as well as branches, were of
silver. But kings went about, and wherever they
went their majesty surrounded them; and consequently,
with the double motive of comfort and of
symbolism, the umbrella was invented as a portable
canopy or tree over the head of the sovereign.</p>

<p>The Greeks noticed and disapproved of the use of
the umbrella.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Xenophon says that the Persians
were so effeminate that they could not content themselves
in summer with the shade afforded by trees
and rocks, but that they employed portable contrivances
for producing artificial shade. But when he
says this, he most certainly refers to the kings, for they
alone had the right to use umbrellas.</p>

<p>On Assyrian and Persepolitan reliefs we have an
eunuch behind the sovereign holding an umbrella
over him when walking, or when riding in his chariot,
or when seated; on a bas-relief of Assur-bani-pal,
however, the king is figured reclining under an overshadowing
vine, which is probably artificial. Firdusi
says of Minutscher: “A silken umbrella afforded
shade to his head.”</p>

<p>M. de la Loubière, envoy extraordinary from the
French King in 1687 and 1688 to the King of Siam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
says in his narrative that the use of the umbrella was
granted by the sovereign to certain highly honoured
subjects. An umbrella with several rings of very
wide expansion was the prerogative of the king alone,
but to certain nobles was granted by princely condescension
the right to have their heads and faces
screened from the sun by smaller shades. In his
quaint old French, M. de la Loubière says that in
the audience-chamber of the king:&mdash;“Pour tout
meuble il n’y a que trois para-sols, un devant la
fenêtre, á neuf ronds, et deux á sept ronds aux deux
côtéz de la fenêtre. Le para-sol est en ce Pais là,
ce que le Dais est en celui-ci”&mdash;that is to say, a
mark of the highest power.</p>

<p>The Mahratta princes had the title of “Lords of
the Umbrella.” The chàta of these princes is large
and heavy, and requires a special attendant to hold
it, in whose custody this symbol of sovereignty
reposes.</p>

<p>In Ava it seems to have been part of the royal title
that the sovereign was “King of the White Elephant
and Lord of Twenty-four Umbrellas.” In 1855 the
King of Burmah directed a letter to the Marquis of
Dalhousie in which he styles himself “His glorious
and most excellent Majesty, reigning over the umbrella-wearing
princes of the East.”</p>

<p>Among the Arabs the umbrella is a mark of distinction.
Niebuhr says that it is a privilege confined
to princes of the blood to use an umbrella.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>In the East the umbrella has come to be regarded
as connected with royalty as much as the crown and
the throne; and among the Buddhists it has remained
so. Four feet from the throne of the Great Mogul, as
described by Tavernier, were two spread umbrellas
of red velvet fringed with pearls, the sticks of which
were wreathed with pearls. Du Halde says that
in the Imperial palace at Pekin there were umbrellas
always ready for the Emperor; and when he rode
out, a canopy was borne on two sticks over his head
to shade him and his horse. Of Sultan Mohammed
Aladdin we are told that he adopted insignia of
majesty hitherto used in India and Persia and unknown
in Islam; among these was a canopy or
umbrella held over his head when he went abroad.
Of one Sultan’s umbrella we are told that it was of
yellow embroidered with gold and surmounted by a
silver dove.</p>

<p>But as the umbrella was the symbol of majesty
held over the king’s head, it behoved the royal palace
to imitate the same, and by its structure show to all
that it was the seat of majesty. Thus came into
use the cupola or dome, and what was given to the
king’s house was given also to the temples. In Perret
and Chapui’s conjectural reconstruction of the temple
of Belus, near Babylon, above the seven stages of the
mighty pyramid, is the shrine of the god surmounted
by a dome. In all likelihood this really was the apex
of the pyramid; the dome was a structural umbrella
held over the supreme god.</p>

<p>The great hall of audience of the Byzantine emperors
was surmounted by a cupola. Two Councils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of the Church, in 680 and 692, were held in it, and
obtained their designation <i>in Trullo</i> from this fact.
From the royal palace the cupola passed to the
church, as the crown of the House of the King of
Kings; and a dome was erected over the church of
the Holy Sepulchre by Constantine, and over the
church of the Eternal Wisdom by Justinian. But it
had already been employed as the crown of a temple,
not only in the Pantheon at Rome, but in the Tholos,
the temple of Marnas or Dagon at Gaza.</p>

<p>The great dome or umbrella by no means excluded
the lesser one beneath it, and kings’ thrones
under cupolas were also over-canopied by structures
of wood, or marble, or metal. Such a <i>baldacchino</i> is
seen over the sun-god in a bas-relief at Sippar. It
became common, and when of wood or metal, was
sculptured, or when of textile work, was embroidered
with leaf and flower-work, retaining a reminiscence
of the original tree beneath which the king sat and
held court. It also passed to the church, and became
a subsidiary umbrella over the altar. Paul the
Silentiary in the sixth century describes that in the
Church of St. Sophia at Constantinople as a dome
resting on four silver pillars. Constantine erected
much the same sort of domed covering above the
tomb of the Apostles in Rome.</p>

<p>In the catacombs, the vaulted chapels and the over-arched
recessed tombs are all attributable to the same
idea; nor has the original notion been lost in them,
for they are frescoed over with vines, bays, and other
foliage. The most beautiful instance is also the
earliest, the squire crypt in the cemetery of Prætextatus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which dates from the second century. Here
the entire vault is covered with trailing tendrils and
leaves with birds perched on them. A couple of centuries
later the original idea was gone, and we find,
instead of a growing tree, only bunches and sprigs of
flowers.</p>

<p>So!&mdash;the umbrellas that pass in the rain under the
shadow of the mighty dome of St. Paul’s are its poor
relations, and my flower-wreathed <i>regenschirm</i> preserves
in its leafage a reminiscence of the original tree;
and the old German woman sits and vends carrots
under what was once the prerogative of the sovereign.
Is this not a token that sovereignty has passed from
the despot to the democracy?<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>A white marble sarcophagus occupies the centre of
one of the rooms on the basement of the Capitoline
Museum in Rome. The cover has been taken off
and a sheet of glass fastened over the coffin, so that
one can look in. The sarcophagus contains the bones
and dust of a little girl. Her ornaments, the flowers
that wreathed the poor little head, are all there, and
by the side is the child’s wooden doll, precisely like
the dolls made and sold to-day.</p>

THE CATACOMB OF ST. AGNESE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the catacomb of St. Agnes one end of a
passage is given up to form a museum of the objects
found in the tombs of the early Christians, and
among these are some very
similar dolls, taken out of the
graves of Christian children. It
was very natural that the parents,
whether Pagan or Christian,
should put the toys of their dear
ones into the last resting-place
with them, not with the idea
that they would want them to
play with in the world beyond
the veil, but because the sight of these dolls would
rouse painful thoughts, and bring tears into the eyes
of the mourners whenever come across in some old
cupboard or on some shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the greatest interest to the student of mankind
are the deposits some 40 ft. deep at La Laugerie on the
banks of the Vézère in Dordogne. Here at the close
of the glacial period lived the primeval inhabitants
of France, at the time of the cave lion, reindeer, and
mammoth. That race knew nothing of the potter’s
art. The reindeer hunter was, however, rarely endowed
with the artistic faculty, and numerous sketches by
him on ivory and bone remain to testify to his appreciation
of beauty of animal form. One day a workman
turned up a doll carved in ivory beside one of
the hearths of this primeval man. He secreted and
sold it, being under a bond to deliver all such finds to
the proprietor of the land. A fellow-workman betrayed
him, and he was obliged to pay back the
money he had received and take the doll to M.
de Vibraye, to whom it was due. In a rage he said,
“Anyhow, he shall not have it perfect,” and he
knocked off the head. In the accompanying sketch
the head is conjecturally restored.
The arms were broken
off when discovered, if there ever
had been arms, which is uncertain.</p>

LAUGERIE HAUTE.</span></p>

<p>(The head restored.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Was this a child’s toy or an
idol of adults? Probably the
former. On some of the engraved
bones of the reindeer
have been found sketches of
singular objects which bear more
resemblance to fetishes, or the
images made and venerated by
Ostjaks and Samojeds, than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thing else. With the savage, as with the child, that doll
receives most regard which is most inartistic, for it allows
greater scope for the imagination to play about it. The
favourite miraculous images are invariably the rudest.</p>

<p>In one of the Bruges churches is a beautiful Virgin
and Child in white marble, one of the few refined and
beautiful things that Michael Angelo’s hand turned
out. But this lovely group does not attract worshippers,
who will be found clustered about, offering their
candles, hanging up silver hearts
about a little monstrosity with
a black face, and neither shape
nor limbs.</p>

<p>Whosoever has little children
of his own can learn a great deal
from them relative to the early
stages of civilisation of mankind.
Every race of men that has not
been given revelation from above
has passed through a period of intellectual and spiritual
infancy, and though men grew to be adults, they never
grew out of the thoughts of a child relative to what
was beyond their immediate sensible appreciation.</p>

<p>I knew a case of a woman of fifty who insisted that
a certain river changed the colour of its water as it
flowed in one place under the shadow of a wood, there
it turned black, in another part of its course it was
white. To the intelligent mind it was obvious enough
that the water remained unaltered, but that it looked
dark where the shadows cut off the light from the sky.
No amount of reasoning could convince the woman
that the water itself did not change its colour from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
black to white. She thought as a child, and was
incapable of thinking otherwise.</p>

<p>Now observe a little child playing with a doll. It
does not regard the doll as a symbol, a representation
of a man or babe, it treats it as a creature endowed
with an individuality and a life of its own. It talks
to it, it feeds it, it puts it to bed, it conjures up a whole
world of history connected with it. It believes the
doll to be sensible to pain, and will cry to see it
beaten. The doll is to it as real a person as one of
its playmates.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/i_b_141.png" width="286" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 35.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">MIRACULOUS IMAGE
AT HAL, BELGIUM.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Now take a savage and his idol. The idol to him
is precisely what the doll is to the child. It thinks,
it eats, it suffers, it is happy. It requires clothes, it
is subject to the same passions as the savage. When
a heathen people has advanced to regard an image as
the symbol of a deity, it has mounted to a higher intellectual
plane; it has stepped from the mental condition
of a child of five to that of one of twelve. If we
want to see what are the thoughts of a savage, who is
in the earliest stage relative to his idol, we must go
to the Ostjak or Samojed on the Siberian tundra,
or to the negro in Central Africa. The Greek, the
Roman, the Egyptian were long past that stage
when they become known to us through history and
their monumental remains. Their images were symbols,
and not properly idols, though there always
remained among them individuals, perhaps whole
strata of people, whose intellectual appreciation of
the images was that of babes. This is not marvellous,
for human progress is always subject to this check,
that every individual born into the world enters, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
his intellectual state, in the condition of the earliest
savage, and has to run through in a few years what
races have taken centuries to accomplish. Where this
is the case, and it is the case everywhere, there will
ever be individuals, perhaps whole classes, whose
mental development will suffer arrest at points lower
than that attained by the general bulk of the men and
women among whom they move.</p>

<p>Even in our own country, the most low and to us
inconceivable ideas relative to God may be found
among the ignorant. If I tell a story it is not to raise
a laugh, but to lift a corner of the veil which covers
these dull minds, to show how little they have reached
the level to which we have ascended.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man declared to the parson of his
parish that he had seen and spoken with the Almighty.
He was asked what He was like. He replied that He
was dressed in a black swallow-tailed coat of the very
best broadcloth and wore a white tie. This was said
with perfect gravity, and with intense earnestness of
conviction. His highest conception of the Deity was
that of a gentleman dressed for a dinner party. Anyone
who has had dealings in spiritual matters with the
ignorant will be able to cap such a story. This is not
to be taken as laughing matter, but as a revelation of
a condition of mind to us scarcely intelligible. I feel
some hesitation in repeating the incident, but do so
because I do not see in what other way I can make
those who have not been in communication with the
very ignorant understand the full depth of their
ignorance.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the ideas that those of a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
mental condition among the savage races have relative
to their idols. I will take the instance of the
Ostjaks and Samojeds. The latter have their <i>Hakes</i>.
They are figures&mdash;sometimes only bits of root of tree
or wood that have a distant resemblance to the human
form, or some unusual shape. Every family has
its <i>Hake</i>&mdash;sometimes has several. These are wrapped
up in coloured rags, given necklaces and bangles, and
a tent or apartment to themselves. They have their
own sledge, the <i>haken-gan</i>, and following after a Samojed
family, on its journey from one camping place to
another, may be seen a load of these unsightly dolls in
their sledge. If some figure out of the usual, in wood
or stone, attracts general attention, and is too big to
be carried about, it is regarded as the <i>hake</i> of a whole
tribe. These images are provided with food. Family
affairs are communicated to them, and they are supposed
to rejoice with domestic joys, and lament
family losses.</p>

<p>When their help is required, offerings are made to
them, but if the desired help be not given, the <i>hake</i>
gets scolded, refused his food, and sometimes is
kicked out into the snow. The face of the <i>hake</i>, or
what serves as face, is smeared with reindeer blood.
It is the same with the Ostjaks. Their idols are
dressed in scarlet, furnished with weapons, and their
faces smeared with ochre. They are called <i>Jitjan</i>.
“Often,” says Castrén, “each of these figures has its
special office. One is supposed to protect the reindeers,
another to help in the fishery, another to care
for the health of the family, etc. When need arrives,
the figures are drawn forth and set up in a tent at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the reindeer pastures, the hunting or fishing grounds.
They are presented with sacrifices now and then, which
consist in smearing their lips with train oil or blood,
and putting before them a vessel with fish or meat.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It is very much the same thing with the negro, who
stands on the same intellectual level as the Siberian
savage. His fetish is anything out of the way&mdash;a
strangely-shaped stone or bit of bone, a bunch of
feathers, a doll, anything about which his imagination
may work, and his reason remain torpid.</p>

<p>I have watched a little boy of six play with a
piece of ash twig. I drew it, and noted what his
proceedings were. He had picked up this twig, and
suddenly exclaimed,
“I have found a
horse. It is lying
down. Get up, horse!
Get up!” He took it
to some grass to make it eat, then went with it to a
pond, and made it drink. There the twig fell in,
and he cried out that the horse was swimming. I
picked out the twig for him. Presently, by throwing
it into the air, he found that his horse could fly.
Finally, he set to work to build a stable, and furnish
it for his horse.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 36.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE HORSE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>I had been reading Castrén’s account of the <i>hakes</i>
and <i>jitjan</i> at the time, and under my eyes was a
child doing with a bit of stick exactly what a Turanian
nomad of full age does now, and has done for
thousands of years. In two or three years this boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mind will have expanded, and his reason have got in
the saddle, and will hold in the imaginative faculty with
bit and bridle, and then he will cease to see horses in
ash twigs; but the wanderers on the Asiatic tundras
have never got beyond the stage of an English child
of six and never will.</p>

<p>I quote a passage from “The Beggynhof; or, City
of the Single,” to show how that it is possible for a
tolerably-educated, religious Belgian of the present
day to stand at the same point as that of a child of
six, and of an Ostjak savage.</p>

<p>“St. Anthony is a favourite saint with the good,
holy, simple-minded Beguines; but woe betide him
if he refuse his powerful intercession. I once saw a
poor little statuette of this domestic saint left outside
on the window-sill when the snow lay deep on the
ground. On inquiring why it did not occupy its place
on the mantelshelf, I was told that the saint had been
refractory; that the Beguine who occupied that room
had been very patient and forbearing for some days,
but that, finding gentleness had no effect in obtaining
what she wanted, she now thought herself justified in
trying what effect punishment would have, so she had
turned the effigy of the rebellious saint out into the
snow, and sat with her back towards it, that her
patron might understand she did not intend to address
him again until he granted her his protection
and influence.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Precisely in like manner, when Germanicus
died, did the rabble of Rome pelt the temples
and statues of the gods with mud and stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
because they had failed to hear their prayers for the
recovery of their beloved prince.</p>

<p>We all of us pass through this stage of intellectual
and spiritual growth, except a few who never get
beyond it. It is said of the negro that as a child he
is clever and bright, but that he never attains
the mental condition of an European of fifteen. But
there are men and women among us who, in certain
matters, never get beyond the condition of mind of a
child of six. We may be shocked at this, but we
cannot help it; they are so constituted&mdash;something
in their cranial structure, or some natural deficiency
in mental vigour is the occasion of this. In religious
matters they cannot get beyond Fetishism; and if
we deny them that, we deny them all religious comfort
and worship. Sometimes, through some accident,
a leg or an arm gets diseased, whereas the rest of the
body grows; so is it with the mind&mdash;certain faculties
get diseased, perhaps the reasoning power, and then
the imagination runs riot.</p>

<p>To an ordinary cultured Pagan of Rome, or Greece,
or Egypt, idolatry was impossible. The gods,
figured in marble and bronze, were to them symbols
and nothing else, precisely as to us the letters of the
alphabet are symbols of certain sounds, and the pictographic
characters of cuneiform and hieroglyphic
writing were anciently symbols of certain ideas. So
also idolatry is absolutely impossible to anyone who
has gone through the elements of modern education.
Religious statues and pictures are historic representations
of personages and events in the sacred story,
but to look upon them with the eyes of an Ostjak or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a child of six is a psychological impossibility, except
only for such as are mentally stunted like the Beguine
of Ghent. It is, therefore, without the smallest scruple
that we can employ imagery in our churches, knowing
that the possibility of misusing it is gone past
reversion to it in nine hundred and ninety-nine
persons out of a thousand, and that the thousandth
person who would misuse it is incapable of any other
religious exercise, and it were better that he had some
religious conceptions, however low these were, than
none at all.</p>

<p>To draw this moral has not been my object in penning
this article, but to direct the attention of the intelligent
to the nursery, and show them how that the
elements for the study of primitive culture, the means
of following the development of ideas in man are to
be found wherever there are little children.</p>

<span class="old">Revivals.</span></h2>


<p>Of the three factors that go to make up man&mdash;body,
intellect, and the spiritual faculty, the last has been
allowed somewhat to fall into neglect in the present
age, when special stress has been laid on the education
and development of the intellect. Nevertheless
it is a factor that must not be ignored, and it is one
that is likely to revenge itself for neglect by abnormal
action.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was the reverse; under the
preponderating influence of the Church, the spiritual
faculty was cultivated to extreme of mysticism, and
the intellect on one side, and the body on the other,
hardly received sufficient recognition. When an
ascetic would neither think out a problem nor keep
himself clean, he exhibited a monstrosity, not as repulsive,
but as certainly a monstrosity, as one of the
gladiators depicted on the pavement of the Baths of
Caracalla&mdash;this latter, a man cultivated to the highest
point of animal strength and physical activity. It is
probable that a purely intellectual man without idealism,
without religiosity, is as much a monster as either
of the other, though not in the nineteenth century as
repugnant to us as they are.</p>

<p>A religion that is good for anything must not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
be one that is intelligible and reasonable, but must
satisfy the spiritual cravings, and also exercise moral
control over the animal nature. At the same time, it
is liable to undue stress in each direction; it may
become a mere theological speculation, mere mysticism,
or resolve itself into exterior formalism. Whenever
it manifests a preponderating tendency in one or
other of these directions&mdash;the element in man that is
not given its adequate scope will revolt, and fling
itself into an opposite scale.</p>

<p>The function of the reason in religion is to act as
the balance wheel of the spirit. Reason is not the
mainspring, not the motive power of religion; it is its
controlling, moderating faculty.</p>

<p>Throughout the history of mankind we are coming
continually upon phenomena of a spiritual nature,
outbursts of the spiritual faculty in strange and often
in very repulsive manifestations, and it may not be
amiss to look at some of these and to learn what is
their real nature.</p>

<p>Among the primitive races which at this day represent
the earliest phases of psychological development,
the savage man has a vague apprehension of the existence
of a spiritual world, haunted by the souls of
the dead which have not been absorbed into the
universal spirit from which they emanated. He has
no definite belief, he has only an apprehension. In
the spiritual world, the existence of which he suspects,
there is no system; concerning it he has no doctrine.
Its existence implies no responsibilities.</p>

<p>Even the idea of an all-pervading spirit is inchoate.
All that man is confident about is that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
is surrounded by and subject to the influences of
spirits, now beneficent, then malevolent, always capricious,
that have to be humoured and propitiated, and
that allow themselves to be consulted.</p>

<p>There is but one, so to speak, natural mode of
holding intercourse with the spirits, and that is by
ecstasy, whether natural or superinduced by narcotics.
The man who falls into hysterics, the man who
is cataleptic, is the natural priest. An hysterical, a
cataleptic condition, is not understood, and just as the
unusual and contorted bit of wood or stone receives
reverence as a fetish, so does the man subject to
unusual fits become a priest. To him the man of
less nervous organism applies when he desires to hold
intercourse with the unseen world. Incantation,
whereby the hysterical work themselves into hysteria,
and religious rite are one. The Shaman or Medicine-man
is the only priest.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is not a people, at a low stage of
mental and moral development, among which this
phase of religion is not found, before the spirit world
coagulates into distinct beings, the rudiments of a
theology appear, the priesthood emerges as a caste,
and worship is fixed in ceremonial observance.</p>

<p>As man advances in the scale of general culture,
and thinks more of the unseen world, his reason or
fancy, or reason and fancy acting together, become
creative; in the protoplastic, nebulous spirit-world
points of light appear, the light is divided from the
darkness, and the spiritual entities take rank, and
assume characteristics. Religion enters on the polytheistic
phase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the moral sense has advanced; it
has seen that there is some relation between the two
worlds determined by good and bad. An ethic code
is evolved, imposed on man by the superior beings in
the world unseen.</p>

<p>But whilst some of the more gifted in a generation
attain to this religious and moral conception, there
remain others, at the same time, unable to rise, who
still occupy the same low level as the earlier men,
who are conscious of spiritual forces, but unable to
differentiate them, who are lost in a vague dream,
incapable of accepting a theologic system, and unwilling
to submit to moral restraint. Such men will
always turn away from a definite creed, view a priestly
caste with suspicion, and kick against an ethical code.
To them the Schaman is still the only priest, and
delirious ecstasy the only sacrament that unites the
worlds. Their psychic development is so rudimentary,
that they are ready to accept as consecrated whatever
utterance is vented, whatever act is performed in the
transport of temporary delirium.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any further with the account of
the growth of religion, it will be well here to give an
account of Schamanism as it at present exists. For
this I will quote a description given by Lieutenant
Matjuschin who accompanied Baron Wrangel on his
Polar Expedition in 1820-3. Lieutenant Matjuschin
visited a Tungu Schaman near the Lena, in 1820.</p>

<p>“In the midst of the gurte (hut) burnt a fire, round
which was laid a circle of black sheepskins. On this
the Schaman paced, uttering his incantations in an undertone.
His black, long, coarse hair nearly covered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
dark-red face; from under his bushy eyebrows gleamed
a pair of glowing bloodshot eyes. His kirtle of skins
was hung with amulets, thongs, chains, bells, and
scraps of metal. In his right hand he held his magic
drum, like a tambourine, in his left an unstrung bow.
By degrees the flame died away; he cast himself on
the ground; after five minutes he broke out into a
plaintive muffled sound like the moans of several
voices. The fire was fanned into a blaze again. The
Schaman sprang up, planted his bow on the earth,
rested his brow on the upper end, and ran at a rapidly
increasing pace round the bow. Suddenly he halted,
made signs with his hands in the air, grasped his drum,
played a sort of melody on it, leaped and twisted his
body into strange contortions, and turned his head
about so rapidly that it seemed to us more like a ball
attached to the trunk by a string. All at once he fell
rigid on the ground; two men whetted great knives
over him, he uttered his mournful tones, and moved
slowly and convulsively. He was forced upright, and
he was as one unconscious, only with a slight quiver in
his body; his eyes stared wildly and fixedly out of
his head, his face was covered with blood, which
poured out with sweat incessantly from his pores. At
last, leaning on the bow, he swung the tambourine
hastily, clattering over his head, then let it fall to
earth. Now he was fully inspired. He stood motionless
with lifeless eyes and face; neither the questions
put to him, nor the rapid unconsidered answers
he gave, produced the slightest alteration in his frozen
features. He replied to the queries, of the majority
of which he can have had no comprehension, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
oracular style, but with great firmness of assurance.
Matjuschin asked how long our journey would last?
Answer, ‘Over three years.’ ‘Would we effect
much?’ ‘More than was expected at home.’
‘Should we all keep our health?’ ‘All but you;
but you will not be really ill?’ (Matjuschin suffered
for a long time with a wound in the throat.) ‘How
is Lieutenant Anjou?’ ‘He is three days distant
from Bulun, where he has taken refuge, having barely
saved his life from a frightful storm on the Lena.’
(This was afterwards found to be true.) Many answers
were so vague and poetical as to be unintelligible.
When we had done questioning him, the Schaman
fell down and remained a quarter of an hour on
the ground suffering from violent convulsions. ‘The
devils are departing,’ said the Tungu, and opened the
door. Then the man awoke as out of a deep sleep,
looked about in a bewildered manner, and seemed
unconscious of what had taken place.</p>

<p>“At another place a Schaman went into ecstasies.
The daughter of the house, a Jakutin, became white,
then red, then the bloody sweat broke out, and she
fell unconscious on the ground. Matjuschin ordered
the Schaman to desist; as he did not, he flung him
out of the house, but he continued his leaps and contortions
outside in the snow. The girl lay stiff, the
lower part of her body swelled, she had cramps,
shrieked, wrung her hands, leaped and sang unintelligible
words; at last she fell asleep, and when she
woke after an hour, knew nothing of what had happened.
Her father told us she often had these ecstasies,
foretold the future, and sang in the Lamutisch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and Tungu languages, which she did not
know.”</p>

<p>Matjutschin remarks on what he saw: “The
Schamans have been represented as being mere
gross deceivers; no doubt this is true of many of
them, but the history of others is very different.
Born with ardent imaginations and excitable nerves,
they grow up amidst a general belief in the supernatural.
The youth receives strong impressions and
desires to obtain communication with the invisible
world. No one teaches him how to do so. A true
Schaman is not a cool and ordinary deceiver, but a
psychological phenomenon.”</p>

<p>These hysterical transports are infectious. Several
cases have been known where a Schaman has begun
his operations, that onlookers have been convulsed,
have communicated their agitation to others, and it
has run through an entire settlement, all becoming
frantic, shouting, rolling on the ground, with nervous
jerks of the head and spasms of the body.</p>

<p>We find precisely analogous practices everywhere
among men on the same psychological platform as
Lapps, Ostjaks, and Tungus. Sometimes medicinal
plants and drugs are used to provoke intoxication or
excite dreams.</p>

<p>Madness, epilepsy, catalepsy, hysteria, in fact all
nervous maladies are at present little understood by
science, and among rude nations, where there is no
science, are not understood at all, and are regarded
with superstitious terror. The violence of the patient,
the fancies that possess him, his incoherent cries, the
distortion of his body, the alteration in his features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
all seem to point out that he has fallen under the
domination of a foreign power, and such a person is
said to be <i>possessed</i>. His actions, his words, are no
longer his own, but those of the spirit that occupies
his body. There was not of old, nor is there still
among savages, any sharp distinction between good
spirits and bad. All spirits are those of the dead.
It is only by those who have advanced to a higher
stage that these are classified as angels or devils. In
Baron Wrangel’s “North Polar Travels,” already
quoted, is another significant passage which illustrates
this point. He says that in Northern Siberia an
epidemic disease called the Mirak appears, which,
according to the universal belief of the people, proceeds
from the ghost of a dead sorceress entering
into and tormenting the patient. But Wrangel says,
“The Mirak appears to me to be only an extreme
form of hysteria; the persons attacked are chiefly
women.”</p>

<p>Our word <i>mania</i> traces back to the period when
the madman was supposed to be possessed by the
<i>manes</i>, the spirit of some dead man; but such an idea
was already abandoned by the classic Roman, who
gave the word to us.</p>

<p>As already said, it was inevitable that Schamanism
should co-exist along with an organised religion, for
only one portion of a people would have made sufficient
progress to be able to receive a dogmatic faith
and accept a formulated worship. There would
always remain a substratum of ignorance and unintelligence
which would have recourse to diviners and
dealers with familiar spirits, that is to Schamans or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
medicine-men. And now we can understand the
true position of the Witch of Endor. The faith of
the Jewish people had taken shape; it had its monotheistic
creed, its altars, and its priesthood, but the
religious development of the people was not on a
level with the scheme of Mosaism. The law was
formal, unspiritual&mdash;that is to say, unsensational&mdash;to
those to whom the only religion that was
acceptable was one of vague spiritualism and ecstatic
hallucination. Saul himself was one of these. As
long as all went well with him he adhered to the
authorised religion, but the moment he was in real
distress and alarm he had recourse to the baser,
proscribed system, level with his own low spiritual
perceptions.</p>

<p>All the denunciations in the Old Testament
against witchcraft are properly denunciations not of
devil worship, but of a relapse from the highly organised
faith, to the inchoate form of religion suitable
only for savages, from which the Divine Revelation
had lifted the sons of Israel. We find precisely the
same condition among the Greeks. They had their
temples, their priests, their mythology. But this was
beyond the spiritual range of some, and these had
recourse to the Goetoi, true Schamans, that took their
title from the cries they uttered. These Goetoi were,
in fact, the successors of the medicine-men of pre-historic
Hellas. They were looked upon with mistrust
and some fear by the superior, cultured classes,
and laws were passed, but always evaded, prohibiting
these men from exercising their functions, and the
people from having recourse to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Superstition has been called the Shadow of
Religion. It may be so regarded, as it always dogs
its steps; but a more exact and philosophic view of
superstition is to regard it as the protoplasm of belief,
co-existing alongside with fully articulated religion,
as the jelly-fish floats in the same wave where the vertebrate-fish
swims. Superstition is the pap of religion
to those incapable of digesting and assimilating a solidified
creed. To those low in the psychic scale there is
a consciousness of spirit; but spirit must be vague, and
the means of holding communion with spirit must be
something that appeals to their coarse, uneducated
fancy, as hysteric convulsions or maniacal ravings.</p>

<p>The Gospel was preached to Jew and Gentile, and
a change came over the face of the religious world.
Religion was carried into an infinitely higher sphere.
Christianity stood above classic Paganism, as classic
Paganism stood above Schamanism.</p>

<p>Let us take a passage from the history of the
Church in Apostolic times, and we shall see the reappearance
of the same phenomenon.</p>

<p>During the course of his second missionary journey,
St. Paul came to Corinth, and abode there
eighteen months, during which time he laboured to
spread the Gospel. He addressed himself first to
the Jews residing in Corinth, but roused so great an
opposition that he turned to the Greeks, and succeeded
so well in gathering about him a crowd of
persons who made profession of conviction, that the
Jews seized and dragged him before Gallio, the
Roman proconsul, accusing him of opposition to the
law of Moses. But the Governor put the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
matter from him, as one out of his jurisdiction, if not
beneath his notice. Shortly after St. Paul departed
to Syria by ship.</p>

<p>It is worth considering the quality of the converts
made at Corinth, that we may understand what
followed. Corinth, the capital of Achaia, was noted
for its wealth and luxury. It was the place for the
performance of the Isthmean games, in which boxing,
horse-racing, and musical contests formed the great
attraction. It was the Newmarket of Greece, and
swarmed with those doubtful characters, of low intellect
and depraved morals, who generally congregate
about the race-course, the boxing-ring, and the
music-hall. The heathen orator, Dio Chrysostom,
who lived at the same time as St. Paul, says of
Corinth that it was verily the most licentious of all
the cities that ever were, and that ever had been.</p>

<p>It was to the people of such a city that St. Paul
addressed himself, and amongst whom he met with
a certain amount of success. He tells us himself to
what class the bulk of his converts belonged. There
were “not many wise men after the flesh,” that is,
very few of the philosophers, the only representatives
of a higher life and clear intelligence, the only men
who struggled after a knowledge of God, and for
pure morality. They stood aloof. There were also
“not many mighty,” few in authority; “not many
noble,” few of the respectable citizens. In fact, he
got his converts from the riff-raff of an utterly vicious
town. We must bear this in mind.</p>

<p>A community of believers gathered from among
the inhabitants of Corinth must have presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
phenomena deserving special attention. Surrounded
by the prevailing immorality, open, flagrant, stalking
the streets, they had ceased from earliest infancy
to blush at evil sights, and words, and thoughts.
They were tainted to the heart’s core. At the same
time they were an excitable people, with high-strung
nervous temperaments, such as are found in a
nursery of the arts, where the sense of physical not of
moral beauty is cultivated.</p>

<p>Such persons were ready, for the sake of its novelty,
to embrace the new religion preached in their
midst. They ran after the new preacher as they
ran to hear a new singer; they took up his doctrine
as they took up a new philosophy, for the sake of its
newness. They rushed into the Church as they
elbowed their way into the theatre. As to realising
the purity, the self-denial that Christianity requires&mdash;of
that they had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>The profession of Christianity subdued these converts
for a while&mdash;for a few months; but though
regenerate in baptism, the old “phronema sarkos”
remained like a sleeping leopard waiting its time to
awake, stretch itself, and seek its prey. Regeneration
is not a magic spell; it is an initiation, not an act.
St. Paul was in Corinth eighteen months only, and in
this short time it was impossible for him to establish
the Church on firm foundations. Besides, he was an
initiator and not by any means an organiser.</p>

<p>He had not been long gone before the natural
result of an indiscriminate conversion made itself
apparent, and St. Paul had to write to the young
Church at Corinth a letter which has been lost or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
suppressed. This was followed by a second, and
that by a third, and we have got only the two latter.
Probably, the Church of Corinth thought it best to
put the first in the fire and not publish its shame.
But the second and third&mdash;the first and second, as we
call them&mdash;throw a tolerably clear light on the state
of this Church.</p>

<p>There were dissensions in it, and no wonder; then
scandal, and, again,&mdash;no wonder. Of the dissensions
I need not speak.</p>

<p>First among the scandals came the Love Feasts.
The feast was instituted in order that all the faithful
might meet, and eat and drink together, the rich
contributing the provisions and sitting down with
the poor. It is not to be confounded with the Holy
Eucharist, which was something quite distinct. The
Love Feast took place at night, the Eucharist in the
early morning.</p>

<p>However excellent in intention the institution might
be, in a very short time it was abused. The well-to-do
brought food and wine with them, and ate and drank
by themselves, apart from the slaves and the members
whom poverty prevented from contributing.
The poor were compelled to look hungrily on, while
the rich brethren, having more than sufficed, indulged
to excess. One was hungry, and another
was drunken.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to trace the origin of these Love
Feasts; they were a local adaptation from the heathen
ceremonial of the Temple of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>The Greeks had mysteries in their principal
temples, into which the devout were initiated. Baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
was one of the initiatory acts. Then the neophytes
were taught certain secret doctrines which
they were forbidden to reveal to the profane without.
After that they partook together of a sacred feast,
and then ensued ecstatic raptures, hysterical ravings,
and orgies of a licentious character in those shrines
dedicated to the goddess of love.</p>

<p>The newly converted Christians of Corinth were
desirous of getting as much excitement out of their
new religion as they could. So they treated Christian
baptism as an initiation into Christian mysteries;
they instituted the Love Feast as a close reproduction
of the banquet with which they were familiar in the
Temple of Aphrodite, and then followed a condition
of disorder very little more decent than the heathen
orgies.</p>

<p>St. Paul notes three abuses, into which these Corinthians
fell, all three borrowed from the heathen mysteries.
They revelled at the Love Feasts, they fell
into moral disorder, and they gave way to hysterical
ravings. The third abuse St. Paul was a little
puzzled at, and he dealt with it more leniently
than with the drunkenness and debauchery of his
converts. He was prepared to humour the wild
exhibition, perhaps in hopes that by degrees the
converts, as they mended their morals, would mend
in this particular also. The outburst of incoherent
ravings to which he referred was much the same as
what had occurred in the heathen mysteries, and
the same phenomena are met with to the present
day among North American Indians and negroes.
We have seen a Schaman in the same state in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Siberia. These Corinthians, some tipsy with the
wine they had drunk in excess, others half starved,
but frenzied by their easily-wrought-on religious feelings,
jabbered disconnected, unintelligible words.
They raved, fell into cataleptic fits, and made a
scene of confusion and uproar such as is hardly to
be found out of the wards of Bedlam.</p>

<p>In the heathen temples women were placed over
cracks in the rock, whence exhaled intoxicating
vapours, and becoming giddy, they uttered oracular
sentences, which were generally nonsense, and could,
therefore, be interpreted to mean anything. The
apostle now met with the outbreak of a phenomenon
among his converts very similar, which he
could not understand, and did not know in what
manner to treat. He contented himself with giving
rules for its direction. He struck at the root of the
spiritual disturbances when he insisted on a moral
reformation. Till that was effected, there would be
no abatement of these perplexing and indecent manifestations.
Where there were incoherent ravings,
there “an interpreter” was to be set in the assemblies
to make what sense he could out of the unintelligible
noises.</p>

<p>The discipline to which the Corinthians were subjected
by St. Paul brought them to some sort of
order for awhile, but it is not to be expected that,
with the lofty standard of life set before them, there
would not be found a considerable number who
would kick at it.</p>

<p>St. Paul, in his polemics against the Judaisers, had
written with heat against the law, and had exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the freedom of the Gospel. He had not supposed it
necessary to nicely discriminate between the ceremonial
obligations and the moral commands of the law.
Accordingly a good many of his converts took the
matter into their own hands, and he was surprised
and confounded to find a party fully prepared to take
his strongest words <i>au pied de la lettre</i>, to roll moral
and ceremonial commands into one bundle, and throw
all overboard.</p>

<p>Accordingly we find that the early Church was
infested with a multitude of Evangelicals, professing
themselves to be disciples of St. Paul, appealing to
his words as their justification, and casting all
morality to the winds.</p>

<p>In the following ages we find exactly the same
sort of scenes as those that startled St. Paul at
Corinth settling into an acknowledged institution,
and ending in such orgies, that the heathen were
almost justified in regarding Christianity as a religious
nuisance, and a danger to common morality.
The accounts we have of the assemblies of the followers
of Valentine, Mark, Carpocrates, Epiphanes,
and Isidore, of the Ophites and Antitactites, present
us with pictures of religious revivals ending in the
orgies of satyrs.</p>

<p>The empire, under Constantine, became Christian.
Then the Church, no longer persecuted, spread
throughout the world with a definite creed, an organised
priesthood, a fixed mode of worship, and a
rigid moral code.</p>

<p>Then, as heretofore, in the early Church, in heathen
Rome and Greece, there were those unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
receive a religion so perfect or so defined. They
must have something vague and rudimentary, something
that did not require too much of them, that did
not lay upon them too many restrictions. These men
sought what suited them in various forms of heresy,
or in the secret performance of Pagan rites, the
heresies all forms of negation, the Paganism altogether
gross and elementary. All these forms of revolt were
reversions to the earliest protoplasmic type. It is not
my purpose to trace the history of these relapses
throughout the Middle Ages, for I am not writing a
history of heresy; my object is simply to note the fact
that Spiritualism or Schamanism constantly appears
in the history of religion, varying its name but few of
its characteristics; sometimes becoming grossly immoral,
sometimes decent, but always whilst professing
almost ascetic virtue with a tendency to licentiousness.</p>

<p>As soon as Christianity became established, at
once all the gods of the heathen became devils, and
their worship the worship of devils. “Idolatry,” said
Eusebius, in the <i>Præparatio Evangelica</i>, “does not
consist in the adoration of good spirits, but in that of
those which are evil and perverse.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The Christian
emperors forbade the sacrifices to the gods, as sacrifices
to devils. In 426, Theodosius II. ordered every
temple to be destroyed. Those who clung to the old
religion were driven to worship on mountains and in
the depths of forests. In 423, he had issued an
injunction against the sacrifices, on this very ground,
that they were made to devils.</p>

<p>What took place in Italy or Greece, took place elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in later days, when the barbarians became Christians,
or, at least, were made nominal Christians,
under Christian Frank emperors. The <i>Indiculus
superstitionum et Paganiarum</i> of the Council of Leptines
in Hainault, in the eighth century, shows us
Paganism completely converted into witchcraft.
Those who were addicted to it went to retired huts
(<i>casulæ</i>) in places formerly held sacred (<i>fana</i>); there
they offered sacrifices to Jupiter, Mercury, or some
other god; they took auguries, drew lots, called up
spirits, made little images of linen and flour, and
carried them about the country, precisely as Sulpicius
Severus says was done by the Gauls in the time
of St. Martin. Pope Gregory III. condemned those
who made sacrifices to fountains and trees, used divinations,
exercised magical rites, in honour of Belus
and Janus, “according to the customs of the Pagans,”
and he anathematised all those who took part in diabolical
rites, and gave worship to devils. Finally
the Capitularies of Charles the Great and his successors
armed the secular power against all these remnants
of idolatry.</p>

<p>At about the same period, the seventh century,
Camin the Wise, Abbot of Hy (Iona), tells us that
the like superstitions prevailed in Ireland.</p>

<p>But, before this, the Council of Ancyra, in 341,
had issued a decree, which has, indeed, been called in
question, but which was embodied in the “Canon
Episcopi,” by which the bishops were required to
exercise vigilant supervision over magical practices,
and especially to excommunicate certain impious
females, who, blinded by the devil, imagined themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
riding through the air in company with Hecate
and Herodias&mdash;Herodias is no other than Hruoda, a
Lombard goddess, the same as the Saxon Ostara.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The injunction was repeated by the Synod of Agde,
in 506, which, with other decrees of the sixth and
seventh centuries, represents witchcraft as a Pagan
delusion. Magic and heresy were one. Heresy was
a turning away from the truth, and magic was its
ritual. Enmity to orthodoxy implied enmity to God,
and enmity to God alliance with the devil.</p>

<p>The charges which had been brought by heathens
against early Christians were now, under altered circumstances,
launched by Christians against heretics
and witches. The hideous description of Christianity
given by Cœcilius, in Minutius Felix, as a secret
and desperate faction leagued against God and man,
and celebrating the foulest nocturnal rites, became
the type of accusations levelled by orthodox Christians
against their dissenting brethren; and, as the
charge of Cœcilius was justified by the conduct
of a portion of the Christian converts, so was the
charge of the orthodox against the schismatics
in mediæval times justified by the conduct of
some of them. The Cathari, Manichæans, Paulicians,
Patarines, Albigenses, were all heretics so
far that they reverted to heathenism, and to its
most simple form of Schamanism, and some of
the congregations sank into the grossest immorality.</p>

<p>The writers on witchcraft who theoretically worked
out its criminal details&mdash;Eumericus, Nider, Bernhard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of Como, and Jacquier&mdash;spoke of it as “Secta et
hæresis maleficorum,” it was a heresy, one of the
several forms in which lapse from the faith took.
Balduinus identified Waldenses with witches.</p>

<p>In 1484, James Sprenger and Henry Justitor, appointed
inquisitors for Upper Germany, obtained the
celebrated bull of Innocent VIII., which, though far
from being the origin of witch prosecutions, acted
with signal effect in promoting their subsequent
activity. Sprenger followed it up with his well-known
treatise called “Malleus Maleficarum,” as a guide to
judicial theory and practice.</p>

<p>No object is gained by dwelling on the details of
an epidemic which, for three centuries, devastated
Europe, destroying so many lives. Yet two particulars
challenge inquiry and remark: one, the strange
uniformity of the offence as elicited by confession;
the other, the curious analogy which is found to exist
between the rites practised by the witches at their
gatherings and those of the heretics of earlier times,
Pagan and semi-Christian. The uniformity in the
confession of the witches has excited surprise, and
has been variously accounted for&mdash;some supposing
that there must have been an external reality in the
way of profane imposture, a remnant of heathen
practice; others referring it to morbid subjectivity
in the accused, caused by melancholy and hypochondria.</p>

<p>That there was some objective reality, I can hardly
doubt; not only are the confessions of those accused
curiously alike in their account of the ceremonies of
the Sabbath, when they assembled, but we know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
human nature is always the same, and it is inconceivable
that there should have been a cessation at
any period of those gatherings of men and women
who found the only satisfaction for their religious
cravings in vague spiritualism.</p>

<p>One may say boldly that Europe was half Pagan
in the Middle Ages; all the old superstitions lived,
but under a new disguise. The religions of Gaul, of
Germany, of Great Britain, of the Scandinavian and
the Slavonic lands, the mythologies of Greece and of
Rome, lived on in a crowd of legends, which modern
erudition delights in collecting and tracing back to
their sources. These legends, more numerous in the
lands occupied by Teutonic peoples, are almost always
of Pagan stuff, embroidered over with Christian
ideas. Not only so, but the very names of the old
gods remain; they no longer remain as the names of
gods held high in heaven, but of devils cast down to
earth. With us the Deuce signifies Satan, and is in
common usage in the mouth as an oath, but he takes
his name from the Dusii, the night genii of the Kelts.
Old Nick again is Hnikr, an honourable designation
of Wuotan, the supreme god of the Anglo-Saxons,
who gives his name to Wednesday.</p>

<p>So, also, we use the word Bogie, Bogart, as a
designation of an evil spirit, and Bug is the name of
a night-tormenting insect. It is well-known that in
an old English Bible the verse in Ps. xci. runs, “He
shall deliver thee from the Bug that walketh in
darkness,” that is, from the Hobgoblin. The
Norsemen and Danes brought this name with them
to England. Bog is in Slavonic God. Biel-bog is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the White God, Czerni-bog is the Black God of
the Slavs.</p>

<p>The Northmen had formerly come across Slavs on
the Continent, and they, the worshippers of Odin,
scorned the gods of the Slavs as devils, and called
all unclean spirits&mdash;Bogs or Bogies. And now, also,
the Supreme God of the Norsemen, Hnikr, has become
our Old Nick.</p>

<p>This being so, it will be seen at once how the
votaries of the dethroned god came to be regarded
as devil-worshippers, and how that in time, when the
old religion with its myths and theogony was long
dead, those who still clung to an hysterical religion,
with love-feasts, dances, and ecstasies, came to believe
themselves to be devil-worshippers.</p>

<p>The Reformation caused such a disturbance of
religious ideas, incited to such revolt against all that
had been held sacred in the past, that it is only
natural that those whose religion had been one of
pure spiritualism, of ecstasy and hysteric raving,
should believe that their day had come. But after
the first explosion, the Reformers set to work to
consolidate their several systems into dogmatic shape;
they drew up Institutes, Confessions, Articles, and
agreed only in this, to put down Mysticism as severely
as they had dealt with Catholicism. And they had
good cause to come to this resolution, for on all sides
the Mystics were breaking forth into the wildest
excesses. In Münster they had set up a Kingdom of
Salem, from which every element of common decency
was expelled, and which knew no law save the
revelations accorded to the prophets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The “spiritually minded,” that is to say, the unintelligent,
hysterically disposed, did not at all relish
the form given to belief, and the discipline of Divine
service framed by the Reformers. They founded sects
on all sides following the old lines of the Markosites
and Cathari.</p>

<p>Bishop Barlow, one of those who helped to draw
up the English Prayer-book, was himself an eye-witness
of the proceedings of some of these sects, and
he describes them in words we do not care to quote.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>England, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, were
overrun with these sectaries, with their love-feasts,
raptures, and license. It was the old story again of
the revolt of the spiritual faculty against the reason,
a story that will be told over and over again as long
as man lives on the earth, and religion is dogmatic
and exercises moral restraint.</p>

<p>One essential condition was always present in
order to produce its effect in these sectarian meetings.
The intellect must remain inactive, the emotions
must be excited, and the sentiment of vague
fear must be specially appealed to and powerfully
wrought upon. It was this condition which determined
the success alike of the revivalist meetings of
the Mystics, and the revelries of the witches. This
condition it was that provoked the orgies at Corinth
among St. Paul’s converts, and the scenes in the
assemblies of the Carpocratites. It was this condition
which roused the attendants on the assemblies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Goeti, of the Dionysian revellers, and of the Schamans
and the medicine men.</p>

<p>These meetings always took place at night. There
is reason to believe that during each day there is a
normal alteration in the functions of the intellectual
and emotional parts of the brain; that during the
sunlight the perceptive faculties and the reflective are
chiefly active; and that these, reposing during the
night, permit the feelings to be mostly dominant;
and it is well-known that general and simultaneous
activity, both of the intellect and of the emotions, is
unnatural; that thought and feeling are antagonistic
to each other. Prayer meetings and witches’ assemblies
alike began after dark and were often continued
till the small hours of the morning. Ignorant men
and women, and the youth of both sexes, were
crowded together to partake in some mysterious
spiritual rite. The quiescence of the observant and
reflective faculties was facilitated, the imagination
goaded and stimulated until it conjured up conceptions
of hell and visions of devils with a vividness
approaching reality; then came cries, tremblings, fallings
on the ground, and raptures.</p>

<p>During Wesley’s preaching at Bristol, “one after
another,” we are told, “sank to the earth.” Men and
women by “scores were sometimes strewed on the
ground at once, insensible as dead men.” During a
Methodist revival in Cornwall, 4000 people, it was
computed, fell into convulsions. “They remained
during this condition so abstracted from every earthly
thought, that they stayed two and sometimes three
days and nights together in the chapels, agitated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the time by spasmodic movements, and taking neither
repose nor refreshment. The symptoms followed
each other usually as follows:&mdash;A sense of faintness
and oppression, shrieks as if in the agony of death,
convulsions of the muscles of the eyelids&mdash;the eyes
being fixed and staring&mdash;and of the muscles of the
neck, trunk, and arms, sobbing respiration, tremors,
and general agitation, and all sorts of strange gestures.
When the exhaustion came on, patients usually
fainted and remained in a stiff and motionless state
until their recovery.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Now let the reader turn back to the account of
the Tungu Schaman, at the beginning of this article.
Is it not obvious that we have here precisely the
same phenomenon?</p>

<p>While at Newcastle, Wesley investigated the
physical effects that resulted from his preaching.
“He found, first, that all persons who had been thus
affected were in perfect health, and had not before
been subject to convulsions of any kind.” Secondly,
that they were affected suddenly. Thirdly, that they
usually fell on the ground, lost their strength, and
were afflicted with spasms. “Some thought a great
weight lay upon them, some said they were quite
choked, and found it difficult to breathe.” Wesley
believed these phenomena were of diabolic origin.
One section of Methodists, in Cornwall and Wales,
was seized with a dancing or jumping mania.
Because David danced before the ark, these fanatics
concluded that jumping and dancing must form an
acceptable form of service. The practice became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
epidemic. Each devotee would caper for hours, till,
completely exhausted, he or she fell insensible.</p>

<p>During a great Presbyterian revival, which passed
over Kentucky and Tennessee in the beginning of
this century, persons swooned away and lay as dead
on the ground for a quarter of an hour; this “falling
exercise” was succeeded by that of the “jerks.” A
Backwoods preacher who has left us his valuable
biography, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A new exercise broke out among us, called the
<i>jerks</i>, which was overwhelming in its effects upon the
bodies and minds of the people. No matter
whether they were saints or sinners, they would be
taken under a warm song or sermon, and seized with
a convulsive jerking all over, which they could not by
any possibility avoid, and the more they resisted, the
more they jerked. I have seen more than five
hundred persons jerking at one time in my large
congregations. Most usually persons taken with the
jerks would rise up and dance. Some would run,
but could not get away. To see those proud young
gentlemen, and young ladies dressed in their silks,
jewelry, and prunella, from top to toe take the jerks,
would often excite my risibilities. The first jerk or
so, you would see their fine bonnets, caps, and combs
fly; and so sudden would be the jerking of the head
that their long, loose hair would crack almost as loud
as a waggoner’s whip.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Another revivalist in Kentucky says; “While
preaching, we have after a smooth and gentle course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of expression suddenly changed our voice and
language, expressing something awful and alarming,
and instantly some dozen or twenty persons, or more,
would simultaneously be jerked forward, where we
were sitting, and with a suppressed noise once or
twice, somewhat like the barking of a dog. One
young woman went round like a top, we think,
at least fifty times in a minute, and continued without
interruption for at least an hour, and one young
woman danced in her pew for twenty or thirty
minutes with her eyes shut and her countenance
calm, and then fell into convulsions; some ran with
amazing swiftness, some imitated the motion of playing
on a fiddle, others barked like dogs.”</p>

<p>Surely we have here a scene precisely identical
in character with that described by Dr. Hecker as
having broke out in Germany in 1374. He says:
“It was called the dance of St. John or of St. Vitus,
on account of the Bacchantic leaps by which it was
characterised. The dancers, appearing to have lost
all control over their senses, continued dancing, regardless
of the bystanders, for hours together in wild
delirium, until at length they fell to the ground in a
state of exhaustion.... While dancing they neither
saw nor heard, being insensible to external impressions
through the senses, but were haunted by
visions, their fancies conjuring up spirits whose names
they shrieked out.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It has happened in some cases, especially in that
of women, that they have tried to tear off their
clothes, and this explains the account given by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
who had attended the Witches’ Sabbath, that many
present were stark naked. We know that some of
the wilder congregations of the Hussites developed
their fanaticism in this form. So did the Anabaptists
in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>We will now take a case or two from the Roman
Communion. Hysteria, as we might suppose, would
be likely to manifest itself in the monastic orders.
St. Joseph of Cupertino was one Christmas Eve in
church, when the pifferari began to play their carols.
Joseph, who was a Franciscan friar, carried away by
religious emotion, began to dance in the midst of
the choir, and then, with a howl, he took a flying leap
and lighted on the high altar. He was then vested
in a gorgeous cope, conducting the service. The
carollers were amazed, no less than the friars; and
their amazement was increased when they saw him
jump from the altar on to the pulpit ledge, fifteen feet
above the ground. One day he went into the convent
choir of the Sisters of St. Clara, at Cupertino. When
the nuns began to sing, Joseph, unable to restrain his
emotion, ran across the chancel, caught the old
confessor of the convent in his arms, and danced with
him before the altar. Then he span himself about
like a teetotum, with the confessor clinging to his
hands, and his legs flying out horizontally.</p>

<p>St. Christina, The Wonderful, a Belgian virgin, used
to go into fits when her religious emotions were
worked upon, put her head between her feet, bending
her spine backwards, and roll round the room or
church like a ball.</p>

<p>St. Peter of Alcantara in his fervours used to strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
himself naked. He would jump, curled up like a
ball, high into the air, and in and out at the church
door. “What was going on in his soul all this while,”
says his biographer, “it is not given to mortals to
declare.”</p>

<p>The numerous cases of possession in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries were nothing but hysterical
disorders, the symptoms precisely those of Methodist
revivals, Witches’ Sabbaths, Paulinian orgies, and
Schamanism.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the witches were always
a prey to extreme exhaustion after they had attended
their Sabbaths, a feature that is invariable after
spiritual raptures.</p>

<p>In Sweden a religious revival took place in 1842-3,
which swept over the country, affecting great numbers
of children. Boys and girls, only eight years of age,
were inspired to preach the Gospel and go about in
bands singing hymns. In the province of Skaraburg,
where the epidemic was least extensive, it numbered,
at least, 3000 victims. The patients had “quaking
fits,” dropped down, became unconscious, had trances,
saw visions, and preached when in an ecstatic state.
Not two centuries before, a similar epidemic had
passed over Sweden, affecting the children, but it
then took a slightly different complexion: it was an
epidemic of witchcraft. In 1669-70, the children
declared that they were transported nightly to the
Blockula, and their condition afterwards was one
of complete prostration.</p>

<p>A Commission was appointed to examine into the
matter, public prayers and humiliations were ordered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and a great number of women and children were
executed for their guilt in having attended these
meetings on the Blockula.</p>

<p>Into the details of the Witch-Sabbaths I have not
entered; it is unnecessary. My object has been to
show that in all likelihood there were such gatherings,
that they took the place of assemblies of Pagan
origin, which were analogous to the assemblies of the
spiritual Pauline heretics in the early Church; that
modern revivals are not derived from these, but are
analogous exhibitions, and that all are alike manifestations
of hysteria, superinduced by a love of the
sensational, a vague credulity, and an absolute stagnation
of the intellectual powers.</p>

<p>We are in the age of compulsory education; in our
Board Schools religious teaching is reduced to the
thinnest gruel, absolutely tasteless, and wholly unnutritious.
We are straining, perhaps over-straining,
the mental faculties, and making no provision for the
co-ordinate development of the spiritual powers in
the soul. The result will be, not that we shall
kill the spiritual faculty, but that we shall drive
it in&mdash;and it will break forth inevitably in extraordinary
and outrageous manifestations. It must
do so&mdash;just as a check to the free action of the
pores superinduces fever. We shall have a sporadic
fever of wild mysticism bursting forth, in the place
of healthy religion. The spiritual element in man
will rebel against compression, will insist on not being
ignored. We are now suffering from the nuisance of
the Salvation Army. But the Salvation Army is a
comparatively innocuous form of reaction, or is comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
innocuous just at present. We do not know
but that it may herald other and worse forms of
spiritual excitement, or that it may not itself develop
in an Antinomian direction. We have no guarantee.
There is a law in these manifestations that is constant.
They all begin in ecstatic raptures and with a
high moral aim, and all inevitably fall into laxity if not
license in morality. The moral sense becomes inevitably
blunted. It ceases to speak and work when
man takes his ecstatic thrills and visions&mdash;which are
veritable hallucinations&mdash;as the guide of his conduct,
in place of the still small voice of conscience, instructed
by the written, revealed law.</p>

<span class="old">Broadside Ballads.</span></h2>


<p>“I love a ballad in print, a’ life,” said Mopsa, in
the “Winter’s Tale,”
and the clown confessed
to the same
liking. “I love a
ballad but even too
well; if it be doleful
matter merrily set
down, or a very pleasant
thing indeed, and
sung lamentably.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 37.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">BALLAD SINGER, FROM A BROADSIDE.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1653, Dorothy
Osborne tells Sir
William Temple that
she has received from
her brother a ballad
“much older than
my ‘Lord of Lorne,’
and she sends it on to him.” Would that she had told
us more about it. And then she writes, “The heat
of the day is spent in reading or working, and about
six or seven o’clock I walk out into a common that
lies hard by the house, where a great many young
wenches keep sheep and cows, and sit in the shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
singing of ballads. I go to them and compare their
voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses
that I have read of, and find a vast difference there;
but, trust me, I think these are as innocent as those
could be. I talk to them, and find they want
nothing to make them the happiest people in the
world but the knowledge that they are so.”</p>

<p>Walton in his “Complete Angler,” printed in the
very same year in which Dorothy Osborne wrote to
her lover of the singing peasant girls, says: “I
entered into the next field, and a second pleasure
entertained me: ’twas a handsome milk-maid, that
had cast away all care, and sung like a nightingale;
her voice was good, and the ditty fitted for it; ’twas
that smooth song which was made by Kit Marlow,
now at least fifty years ago; and the milk-maid’s
mother sung an answer to it, which was made by Sir
Walter Raleigh in his younger dayes.”</p>

<p>We know what the song was, “Come, live with me
and be my love.”</p>

<p>The mother says to Walton, “If you will but speak
the word, I will make you a good sillabub, and then
you may sit down in a hay-cock and eat it, and
Maudlin shall sit by and sing you the good old song
of the Hunting in Chevy Chase, or some other good
ballad, for she hath good store of them: Maudlin
hath a notable memory.”</p>

<p>But ballad-singing was not confined to milk-maids
and clowns, for Walton proposes to spend a pleasant
evening with his brother, Peter, and his friends, “to
tell tales, or sing ballads, or make a catch, or find
some harmless sport to content us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a somewhat sad fact&mdash;fact it is, that the
ballad is at its last gasp among us. It has gone
through several phases, and it has now reached the
last, when it disappears altogether.</p>

<p>The ballad was anciently a story set to music, and
music to which the feet could move in dance. The
<i>ballet</i> is the dance to which the <i>ballad</i> was sung. It
was not always danced to, but it always could be
danced to. It was of great length, but not too long
for light hearts or light feet on a threshing-floor.
The ballad was accommodated to the exigencies of the
dance, by being given a burden, or <i>bourdon</i>, a drone
that was sung by the young men, when no bagpipe
was there. This burden appears in numerous ballads,
and has usually no reference to the story told by the
singers, and when printed is set in italics. In the
scene in the “Winter’s Tale,” already quoted, the
servant alludes to these burdens, “He has the
prettiest love-songs for maids&mdash;with such delicate
burdens of ‘dildos and fadings.’”</p>

<p>Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There was a lady in the North country,</div>
<div class="verse i2"><i>Lay the bent to the bonny broom</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">And she had lovely daughters three,</div>
<div class="verse i2"><i>Fa, la la la; fa, la la la ra re</i>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">or:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There were three sisters fair and bright,</div>
<div class="verse i2"><i>Jennifer, Gentle, and Rosemaree</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">And they three loved one valiant knight,</div>
<div class="verse i2"><i>As the doo (dove) flies over the mulberry tree</i>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the first edition of Playford’s “Dancing Master,”
in 1650-1, nearly every air can be proved to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that of a song or ballad of earlier date than the book.
Of these only a few have the words preserved, and
we cannot be sure that the words of those we have
got were the original, as ballads were continually
being written afresh.</p>

<p>It was not till about 1690 that tunes were composed
expressly for dancing, and in the later editions
of the “Dancing Master,” 1715 and 1728, about half
the airs given are old ballad tunes. The other half,
newly composed dance tunes, had no traditional
words set to them, and none were composed to fit
them.</p>

<p>In the old English romance of “Tom of Reading,”
printed before 1600, we have an instance of the way
in which a ballad came to be turned into a dance.
Tom Dove was an Exeter clothier passionately fond
of music. William of Worcester loved wine, Sutton
of Salisbury loved merry tales, Simon of Southampton
“got him into the kitchen and to the pottage
and then to a venison pasty.”</p>

<p>Now a ballad was composed relative to Tom of
Exeter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Welcome to town, Tom Dove, Tom Dove,</div>
<div class="verse i2">The merriest man alive.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy company still we love, we love,</div>
<div class="verse i2">God grant thee well to thrive.</div>
<div class="verse">And never will we depart from thee</div>
<div class="verse i2">For better or worse, my joy!</div>
<div class="verse">For thou shalt still have our good-will,</div>
<div class="verse i2">God’s blessing on my sweet boy.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">And the author adds, “This song went up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
through the whole country, and at length became a
dance among the common sort.”</p>

<p>The old heroic ballad was a <i>geste</i>, and the singer
was a gestour. Chaucer speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Jestours that tellen tales</div>
<div class="verse">Both of seeping and of game.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">The tales of game were stories calculated to provoke
laughter, in which very often little respect was paid to
decency; sometimes, however, they were satirical.
These tales of game were much more popular than
those of weeping, and the gestour, whose powers
were mainly employed in scenes of conviviality, finding
by experience that the long lays of ancient
paladins were less attractive than short and idle tales
productive of mirth, accommodated himself to the
prevailing coarse taste, and the consequence was that
nine of the pieces conceived in a light vein have been
preserved to every one of the other.</p>

<p>In the “Rime of Sir Thopas,” Chaucer speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i3">“Minestrales</div>
<div class="verse">And gestours for to tellen tales,</div>
<div class="verse">Of romaunces that ben reales,</div>
<div class="verse">Of popes and of cardinales</div>
<div class="verse i4">And eke of love-longing.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">Here we have the historic geste and the light and
ribald tale. When Chaucer recited the Ballad of
Sir Thopas, conceived after the fashion of the old
romances, the host interrupted him and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“This may well be rime&mdash;dogerel,</div>
<div class="verse">Mine eres aken of thy drafty speche.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>We heartily wish that Chaucer had finished the tale.
The host merely repeated the general objection to
the heroic ballad, and showed the common preference
for the ribald tales. The author of the “Vision
of Piers the Ploughman,” complains that the passion
for songs and ballads was so strong that men attended
to these to the neglect of more serious and
of sacred matters.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“I cannot parfitly my paternoster, as the priest it singeth,</div>
<div class="verse">But I can ryme of Roben Hode, of Randolf erl of Chester,</div>
<div class="verse">But of our Lord and our Lady I learn nothing at all;</div>
<div class="verse">I am occupied every day, holy daye and other, with idle tales at the ale.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The degradation in the meaning of the names
once given to minstrels of various classes tells its
own sad tale. The <i>ryband</i> has lent his name to
ribaldry; the <i>scurra</i> to whatever is scurrilous; the
<i>gestour</i>, who sang the <i>gestes</i> of heroes, became the
jester, the mere buffoon; the <i>joculator</i> degenerated
into a joker; and the <i>jongleur</i> into a juggler.</p>

<p>A few men of taste and of reverence for the
past stood up for the old heroic ballads, which,
indeed, contained the history of the past, mixed with
much mythical matter. So the great Charles, says
his scribe, Eginhard, “commanded that the barbarous
and most ancient song in which the acts and
wars of the old kings were sung should be written
down and committed to memory.” And our own
Alfred, says Asser, “did not fail to recite himself and
urge on others, the recitation by heart of the Saxon
songs.” But the English ballad found no favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with the Norman conquerors, who readily received
the Provençal troubadour. The old heroic ballad
lingered on, and was killed, not so much by the
ridicule of Chaucer as by the impatience of the
English character, which will not endure the long-drawn
tale, and asks in preference what is pithy and
pointed.</p>

<p>Of song and ballad there were many kinds, characterised
rather by the instrument to which it was sung,
than by the nature of the song itself; or perhaps we
may say most justly that certain topics and certain
kinds of composition suited certain instruments, and
were, therefore, accommodated to them.</p>

<p>In the “Romans de Brut” we have a list of some
of these:</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Molt ot a la cort jugleors,</div>
<div class="verse">Chanteors, estrumanteors;</div>
<div class="verse">Molt poissiez oir chançons,</div>
<div class="verse">Rotruanges et noviaz sons</div>
<div class="verse">Vieleures, lais, et notes,</div>
<div class="verse">Lais de vieles, lais de rotes,</div>
<div class="verse">Lais de harpe et de fretiax.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we have the juggler, the chanter, and the
strummer. What the <i>strumentum</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was we do not
exactly know, but it was clearly a stringed instrument
that was twanged, and it has left its reminiscence
in our language,&mdash;every child strums before it
can play a piano. There exists an old table of civic
laws for Marseilles of the date 1381, in which all
playing of minstrel and jongleur,&mdash;in a word, all
strumming was disallowed in the streets without a
license.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>To return to the passage quoted from the “Romans
de Brut,” we have among the chançons, those on the
rote, and those on the vielle, those on the harp and
those on the fret, (<i>i.e.</i> flute).<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The rote was a pierced
board, over which strings were drawn, and it could
be played with both hands, one above, the other below,
through the hole. The vielle was a hurdy-gurdy.</p>

<p>A healthier taste existed in Scotland than in England,
and the old heroic ballads were never completely
killed out there. In England they had been expelled
the court, and banished from the hall long before
they disappeared from the alehouse and the cottage.
The milk-maids sang them; the nurses sang them;
the shepherds sang them; but not the cultured ladies
and gentlemen of the Elizabethan period. The
musicians of that period set their faces against ballad
airs, and introduced the motette and madrigal, in which
elaborate part-singing taxed the skill of the performers.
But the common people loved the simple melodious
ballads. Miles Coverdale, in his “Address unto
the Christian Reader,” in 1538, which he prefixed to
his “Goastly Psalms,” laments it. “Wolde God that
our mynstrels had none other thynge to play upon,
neither our carters and pluomen other thynge to
whistle upon, save psalmes, hymns, and such godly
songes. And if women at the rockes (distaff), and
spinnynge at the wheles, had none other songes to
pass their tyme withal than such as Moses’ sister ...
songe before them, they should be better occupied
than with, <i>Hey nonny nonny</i>,&mdash;<i>Hey trolly lolly</i>, and
such like fantasies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Laneham, in 1575, thus describes his evening
amusements: “Sometimes I foot it with dancing;
now with my gittern, and else with my cittern, then
at the virginals (ye know nothing comes amiss to
me); then carol I up a song withal; that by and by
they come flocking about me like bees to honey; and
ever they cry, ‘Another, good Laneham, another!’”</p>

<p>In the great agitation of minds caused by the
Reformation, the itinerant minstrels were an element
of danger to the Crown, for they kept alive the popular
feeling against the changes in religion, and the
despotic measures of the Sovereign. Moreover, an
immense number of ballads were printed, having a
religious or political character, were set to the old
ballad airs, and sung in place of the traditional lays,
and then hawked by the singers. Accordingly, in
1543, an Act was passed “for the advancement of
true religion,” and it recites that, forasmuch as
certain froward persons have taken upon them to
print “ballads, rhymes, etc., subtilly and craftily to
instruct His Highness’ people untruly, for the reformation
whereof His Majesty considereth it most
requisite to purge the realm of all such books,
ballads, rhymes, and songs.” The Act contains a list
of exceptions; but it is noticeable that no ballads of
any description were excepted.</p>

</div>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth another Act was
passed, in 1597, against “minstrels wandering
abroad,” by virtue of which they were to be whipped,
put in the stocks, and imprisoned, if caught going
from place to place with their ballads.</p>

<p>Then came the period of Puritan domination under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the Commonwealth, when every engine was set to
work to suppress popular music and ballad singing, and
to sour the English character. The first Act levelled
against them and stage players was in 1642. In the
following year a tract was issued complaining that
this measure had been ineffective, in which the
writer says, “Our musike that was held so delectable
and precious that they scorned to come to
a tavern under twenty shillings salary for two hours,
now wander with their instruments under their
cloaks (I mean such as have any), to all houses of
good fellowship, saluting every room where there is
company with, <i>Will you have any musike, gentlemen?</i>”
But even the license to go round the
country was to be denied the poor wretches.
In 1648 Captain Bertham was appointed Provost
Marshall, “with power to seize upon all ballad-singers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and to suppress stage-plays.” The third
Parliament of Cromwell struck the heaviest blow
of all. It enacted that any minstrel or ballad-singer
who was caught singing, or making music in
any alehouse or tavern, or was found to have asked
anyone to hear him sing or play, was to be haled
before the nearest magistrate, whipped and imprisoned.</p>

<p>With the Restoration came a better time for
ballad-singing; but the old romantic ballad was
almost dead, and though many of the ancient
melodies remained, to them new ballads were set.
Of these vast numbers poured from the press. The
printed ballad which supplanted the traditional ballad
was very poor in quality. It turned on some
moral or religious topic; it satirised some fashion of
the day; it recorded in jingling rhymes some fire,
earthquake, flood, or other accident. Above all, it
narrated the story of a murder. Now for the first
time did the vulgar assassin stand forward as the hero
of English poetry and romance.</p>

<p>Many an old song or ballad was parodied. Thus
the famous song of “The Hunt is up,” was converted
into a political ballad in 1537; and a man named
John Hogon was arrested for singing it. “An Old
Woman Clothed in Grey” was the tune to which all
England rang at the Restoration, with the words,
“Let Oliver now be forgotten.” “Grim King of the
Ghosts” was made use of for “The Protestants’
Joy,” a ballad on the coronation of King William
and Queen Mary; and “Hey, then, up go we!”
served, with parodied words against the Rump Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
as the “Tories’ Delight,” as an anti-Papal
ballad, and even as a ballad on the great frost of the
winter of 1683-4.</p>

<p>The dissociation of the old tunes from the ballads
that had given them their names, and to which they
had been composed, did much to occasion the loss of
our early ballads. Not only so, but with James I.’s
reign there came in a fashion for recomposing the old
themes in the new style; and the new editions
caused the disappearance of the earlier ballad. There
can be little doubt that the romantic and historic
ballad, which has been happily preserved in Scotland,
was common to all English-speaking people. These
ballads are called Scottish, because they have been
preserved in Scotland, but it is more than doubtful
that they are of Scottish origin. Ballads travelled
everywhere. We have in Thomas of Erceldoune’s
“Sir Tristram,” an instance of a French metrical
romance turned into a long poem in Scotland, in the
thirteenth century. Many of the Scottish ballads
have, as their base, myths or legends common to all
the Norse people, and found in rhymes among them.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this century, Mr. Davis Gilbert
published a collection of Cornish Christmas Carols,
and subjoined a couple of samples of the ballads
sung by the Cornish people. One is “The Three
Knights.” It begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There did three knights come from the West,</div>
<div class="verse i2">With the high and the lily oh!</div>
<div class="verse">And these three knights courted one lady,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And the rose was so sweetly blown.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">This is precisely the ballad given by Herd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
others as “The Cruel Brother.” One version in
Scotland begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There was three ladies play’d at the ba’</div>
<div class="verse i2">With a hegh-ho! and lily gay;</div>
<div class="verse">There came a knight and play’d o’er them a’,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And the primrose spread so sweetly.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">But another version sung in Scotland begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There was three ladies in a ha’,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Fine flowers i’ the valley;</div>
<div class="verse">There came three lords among them a’,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Hi’ the red, green, and the yellow.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">Now, the remarkable thing is, that there is still sung
in Cornwall&mdash;or was, till quite recently&mdash;a form of the
ballad with a burden like this latter. It begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There was a woman and she was a widow,</div>
<div class="verse i2">O the red, the green, and the yellow!</div>
<div class="verse">And daughters had three as the elm tree,</div>
<div class="verse i2">The flowers they blow in the valley.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">with this chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“The harp, the lute, the fife, the flute, and the cymbal.</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet goes the treble violin,</div>
<div class="verse">The flowers that blow in the valley.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How is it possible that a ballad sung in two forms
in Scotland, and recovered there in a fragmentary
condition, should be known in very similar forms in
Cornwall? To suppose that the two versions were
carried from the Highlands to the Land’s End, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have become popular, is inconceivable. It is more
likely that the same English ballad found its way
both north and south-west, and when it had been
displaced elsewhere, remained in the extremities of
the island. The burden in each case is clearly that
which marked the melody. We very much wish
that the Scottish airs, to which these ballads were
sung, had been preserved, that they might be compared
with those to which they were sung in Cornwall. The
burden in each case has nothing to do with the story,
but it seems to indicate that the same ballad in its
two forms, to two independent airs, was carried all
over Great Britain at some period unknown. The
same ballad was also sung in Cheshire at the close of
last century, and also in Ireland.</p>

<p>Another specimen given by Mr. Gilbert is that of
the “Three Sisters.”</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“There were three sisters fair and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Jennifer, Gentle and Rosemaree;</div>
<div class="verse i5">And they three loved one valiant knight;</div>
<div class="verse">As the doo (dove) flies over the mulberry tree.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same is found in broadside, in the Pepysian
and other collections, and as “The Unco Knicht’s
Wooing” in Scotland.</p>

<p>Take again the ballad of “The Elfin Knight” or
“The Wind hath blown my Plaid away.” This is
found in Scotland, but also as a broadside in the
Pepysian collection; it was the subject within the
memory of man of a sort of play in farmhouses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Cornwall; it is found in a more or less fragmentary
condition all over England. The same ballad is
found in German, in Danish, in Wend&mdash;and the story
in Tyrol, in Siberia, and Thibet.</p>

<p>Buchan, in his “Ballads of the North of Scotland,”
gives the ballad of “King Malcolm and Sir Colvin,”
but it is based on a story told by Gervase of Tilbury, in
his Otia Imperialia, and the scene is laid by him on
the Gogmagog Hills in Cambridgeshire. He wrote
in the 12th century, and his story is clearly
taken from a ballad. So also Buchan’s “Leesome
Brand” is found in Danish and Swedish. And
“The Cruel Sister” is discovered in Sweden and
the Faroe Isles. At an early period there was a
common body of ballad, where originated no one
can say; the same themes were sung all over
the North of Europe, and the same words, varied
slightly, were sung from the Tweed to the Tamar, in
the marches of Wales and in Ireland.</p>

<p>The greatest possible debt of gratitude is due to the
Scots for having preserved these ballads when displaced
and forgotten elsewhere, and it speaks volumes for
the purity of Scottish taste that it appreciated what
was good and beautiful, when English taste was
vitiated and followed the fashion to prefer the artificial
and ornate to the simple and natural expression
of poetic fancy.</p>

<p>It has been said that about the period of James I.,
the fashion set in for re-writing the old ballads in the
style then affected.</p>

<p>There is a curious illustration of this accessible.</p>

<p>A ballad still sung by the English peasants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
found in an imperfect condition in Catnach’s broadsides,
is “Henry Martyn.” It is couched in true
ballad metre, and runs thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“In merry Scotland, in merry Scotland</div>
<div class="verse i2">There lived brothers three,</div>
<div class="verse">They all did cast lots which of them should go</div>

</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“The lot it fell upon Henry Martyn,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“He had not a-sailed a long winter’s night,</div>

<div class="verse">Before he espied a gay merchant ship</div>
<div class="verse i2">Come sailing along that way.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“Oh when that she came to Henry Martyn,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Oh prithee, now let me go!</div>

<div class="verse ic">“How far? how far? cries Henry Martyn,</div>
<div class="verse i2">How far do you make it? says he,</div>
<div class="verse">For I am a robber upon the salt seas,</div>
<div class="verse i2">To maintain my brothers and me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“They merrily fought for three long hours,</div>
<div class="verse i2">They fought for hours full three.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>


<div class="verse ic">“’Twas a broadside to a broadside then,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And a rain and a hail of blows.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“Bad news! bad news through London street,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Bad news has come to the King,</div>
<div class="verse">For all the brave lives of his mariners lost,</div>
<div class="verse i2">That sunk in the watery main.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">Now there is sad confusion here. The ballad as it
now exists is a mere fragment. Clearly the “bad
news” belongs to an earlier portion of the ballad, and
it induces the King to send against the pirate and to
sink his vessel. This “Henry Martyn” is, in fact,
Andrew Barton. In 1476, a Portuguese squadron
seized a richly laden vessel, commanded by John
Barton, in consequence of which letters of reprisal
were granted to Andrew, Robert, and John Barton,
sons of John, and these were renewed in 1506. The
King of Portugal remonstrated against reprisals for
so old an offence, but he had put himself in the
wrong four years before, by refusing to deal with a
herald sent by the Scottish King for the arrangement
of the matter in dispute. Hall, in his Chronicle,
says: “In June, 1511, the King (Henry VIII.) being
at Leicester, tidings were brought him that Andrew
Barton, a Scottish man, and a pirate of the sea, did
rob every nation, and so stopped the King’s streams
that no merchants almost could pass, and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
took the Englishmen’s goods, he said they were
Portingale’s goods, and thus he haunted and robbed
at every haven’s mouth. The King, moved greatly
with this crafty pirate, sent Sir Edward Howard, Lord
Admiral of England, and Lord Thomas Howard, son
and heir to the Earl of Surrey, in all haste to the sea,
which hastily made ready two ships, and without any
more abode, took the sea, and by chance of weather,
were severed. The Lord Howard lying in the
Downs, perceived when Andrew blew his whistle to
encourage the men, yet, for all that, the Lord
Howard and his men, by clean strength, entered the
main deck; then the Englishmen entered on all
sides, and the Scots fought sore on the hatches, but,
in conclusion, Andrew was taken, which was so sore
wounded that he died there; then all the remainder
of the Scots were taken with their ship, called the
<i>Lion</i>.”</p>

<p>Buchanan, about twenty years after Hall&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in
1582&mdash;also tells the story. Barton he calls Breton
with further details. He says that Andrew Breton,
though several times wounded, and with one leg
broken by a cannon ball, seized a drum and beat a
charge to inspirit his men to fight, until breath and
life failed.</p>

<p>Now a ballad relative to Sir Andrew Barton has
been given by Percy; it is found among the Douce,
the Pepysian, the Roxburghe, the Bagford, and the
Wood collection of old English ballads. In the
Percy MS. the ballad consists of eighty-two stanzas,
but there is something lost between the thirty-fifth
and the next. It begins:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“As itt beffell in Midsummer-time</div>
<div class="verse i2">When birds sing sweetlye on every tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Our noble king, King Henry the Eighth,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Over the river Thames past he.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another version is in the black letter collection.
It begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“When Flora, with her fragrant flowers,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Bedeckt the earth so firm and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">And Neptune, with his dainty showers,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Came to present the month of May,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“King Henry would a progress ride;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Over the river Thames past he,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon a mountain top also</div>
<div class="verse i2">Did walk, some pleasure for to see.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">The first is a recomposition of the earlier ballad in
the reign of James I. It makes a historical blunder.
It supposes that Lord Charles Howard, who was not
born till twenty-five years after the death of Andrew
Barton, was sent against the pirate. The memory of the
admiral who served against the Armada had eclipsed
the fame of the earlier high admiral. The fact of
this historic error existing in the ballad marks it as
a late composition.</p>

<p>The second ballad is a still later recast, probably
of the reign of Charles II. These two later versions
would be all that we have, had not the popular
memory held to the earliest and original ballad&mdash;because
associated with a remarkably fine melody.
Unhappily, it has retained but a few of the stanzas.</p>

<p>The Robin Hood ballads most fortunately escaped
remodelling, and they retain the fresh character of
the ancient ballad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Ravenscroft preserved some ballads in his “Deuteromelia,”
1609. One begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Yonder comes a courteous knight</div>
<div class="verse i2">Lustily raking over the lay.</div>
<div class="verse">He was full ’ware of a bonny lasse,</div>
<div class="verse i2">As she came wandering over the way.</div>
<div class="verse">Then she sang, downe a down a down,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Hey down derry.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another is “John Dory”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“As it fell on a hole day</div>
<div class="verse i2">And upon a hole tide,</div>
<div class="verse">John Dory bought him an ambling nag,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Ambling nag to Paris for to ride.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Who liveth so merry in all the land</div>
<div class="verse">As doth the poor widow that selleth sand,</div>
<div class="verse">And ever she singeth as I can guess,</div>
<div class="verse">Will you buy my sand, my sand, mistress?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Also:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“The Flye she sat in the shamble row,</div>
<div class="verse">And shambled with her heels, I trow,</div>
<div class="verse">And then came Sir Cranion</div>
<div class="verse">With legs so long and many a one.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A few&mdash;but only a few, unspoiled ballads have
found their way into print in broadsides. Such are,
“The Baffled Knight,” “The Knight and the
Shepherd’s Daughter,” “Lord Thomas and the
fair Eleanor,” “Barbara Allen,” “The Bailiff’s
Daughter of Islington,” “The Brown Girl.” They
are miserably few, but they are all that remain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
us of the ballad poetry of England, except what
has been preserved to us by the Scotch, who
knew better than ourselves what was good, and had
a finer poetic sense.</p>

</div>

<p>Moreover, our English ballad collectors never went
to the right sources. There were to be had black
and white letter broadsides, more or less scarce, and
they set their booksellers to work to gather for them
the drifting sheets, and fondly thought that they were
collecting the ballad poetry of England. They were
collecting make-shifts, the wretched stuff which had
ousted the old ballad poetry. It occurred to none
of them to go to the people. What would have been
the result had Motherwell, Kinloch, Buchan, and
Herd set to work in the same fashion? There is to
be found in the British Museum a volume of Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Broadside Ballads printed at Aberdeen, and Glasgow,
and Edinburgh. What do these sheet ballads contain?
As great rubbish as do the English broadsides?
Herd, Motherwell, and Buchan had more sense than
our Ritson, Phillips, and Evans; they sat at the feet
of the shepherds, listened beside the wheels of the
old spinners, sat at the tavern table and over the peat
fires with the peasants, and collected orally. Percy
went to his MS. folio, Ritson to his booksellers, and
passed over the great living wellspring of traditional
poetry. Now it is too late. The utmost that can be
gleaned is fragments. But enough does remain
either in MS. or in black letter broadside, or in
allusion and quotation by our early dramatists, to
show that we in England had a mass of ballad
poetry, one in kind and merit with the Scottish.</p>

<p>The first collection of scattered ballads and songs
in a garland was made in the reign of James I., by
Thomas Delony and Richard Johnson, and from that
time forward these little assemblages of fugitive
pieces were issued from the press. They rarely contain
much that is good; they are stuffed with recent
compositions. Everyone knew the traditional ballads,
and it was not thought worth while reprinting them.
A new ballad had to be entered at Stationers’ Hall,
and composer as well as publisher reaped a profit
from the sale, as a novelty.</p>

<p>The old tunes remained after that the words to
which they had been wedded were forgotten; and it
may be said that in the majority of cases the music
is all that does remain to us of the old ballad song of
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The ring of the latter is fresh and pleasant; the
former have no ring at all. The first articles are
manufactured in a garret by a publisher’s poetaster,
the latter have sprung spontaneously from the hearts
of the people in the merry month of May.</p>

<p>Of black-letter printed ballads, the earliest we have
are, “The Nut-brown Maid,” which was discovered
in a book of customs, dues, etc., published at Antwerp,
about 1502, and “The Ballade of the Scottish
King,” written by John Skelton, poet laureate to
King Henry VIII., and of the date 1513. This was
found within the binding of an old book that was
knocking about on the floor of a garret in a farmhouse
at Whaddon, in Dorset. Mr. Arber’s Transcripts
of the entries in Stationers’ Hall give us the
list of ballads issued from the press, with their dates.</p>

<p>The list begins in the year 1557. We will take a
few extracts only.</p>

<p>1588, 4th March. John Wolfe obtained leave to
print three ballads; one was, “Goe from my window,
goe.” Now this no longer exists as a ballad, but as
a folk-tale, in which occur snatches of rhyme, with a
certain melody attached to them; and this air, with
the snatches of rhyme, has been preserved. Both
are printed by Mr. Chappell in his “Popular Music
of the Olden Time.” What the subject of the ballad
was the writer learned from a blacksmith, who told
him that he was in a village inn about 1860, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
very old man came in, and standing by the fire, recited
and sang the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Two men courted a pretty maid; the one was rich,
the other was poor; and the rich man was old, but
the poor man she loved; he was young. Her father
forced her to marry the rich man, but still she loved
the poor man; and sometimes he came under her
window and tapped, and when the husband was away
she let him in.</p>

<p>“So passed a twelvemonth and a day, and she had
a little child.</p>

<p>“Then one night the lover came under the window,
thinking her goodman was from home. With his
tapping the husband woke, and asked what the
sound was. She said an ivy leaf was caught in a
cobweb, and fluttered against the pane. Then the
lover began to call, and her husband asked what that
sound was. She said the owls were hooting in the
night. But fearing lest her lover should continue to
call and tap, she began to sing, as she rocked the
cradle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“‘Begone, begone, my Willy, my Billy!</div>
<div class="verse i2">Begone, my love and my dear.</div>
<div class="verse i6">O the wind, and O the rain,</div>
<div class="verse i6">They have sent him back again,</div>
<div class="verse i2">So thou can’st not have a lodging here.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Again the lover tapped, and the husband asked
what that meant. She said it was a flittermouse that
had flown against the pane. Then she sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“‘Begone, begone, my Willy, my Billy!</div>
<div class="verse i2">Begone, my love and my dear.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<div class="verse i6">O the weather is so warm,</div>
<div class="verse i6">It will never do thee harm,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And thou can’st not have a lodging here.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Then the lover began to call a third time, and
the husband asked what it was. She said it was the
whistling of the wind among the trees, and she
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“‘Begone, begone, my Willy, my Billy!</div>
<div class="verse i2">Begone, my love and my dear.</div>
<div class="verse i6">O the wind is in the West,</div>
<div class="verse i6">And the cuckoo’s in his nest,</div>
<div class="verse i2">So thou can’st not have a lodging here.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Again the lover tapped. Then she sprang out of
bed, threw open the casement, and sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“‘Begone, begone, my Willy, you silly;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Begone, you fool, yet my dear.</div>
<div class="verse i6">O the devil’s in the man,</div>
<div class="verse i6">And he can not understan’</div>
<div class="verse i2">That he cannot have a lodging here.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The melody was arranged for Queen Elizabeth,
and is in her Virginal Book. In Beaumont and
Fletcher’s “Knight of the Burning Pestle,” old
Merrythought says,</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Go from my window, love, go;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Go from my window, my dear.</div>
<div class="verse i6">The wind and the rain</div>
<div class="verse i6">Will drive you back again;</div>
<div class="verse i2">You cannot be lodged here.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“Begone, begone, my juggy, my puggy;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Begone, my love, my dear.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<div class="verse i6">The weather is warm;</div>
<div class="verse i6">’Twill do thee no harm;</div>
<div class="verse i2">Thou can’st not be lodged here.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is again quoted in Fletcher’s “Monsieur
Thomas,” and again in “The Tamer Tamed.”</p>

<p>Almost certainly this was originally a ballad. But
the ballad tale has been lost, and only scraps of
rhyme were committed to writing.</p>

<p>1588, 26th Sept. John Wolfe had license to print
“Peggy’s Complaint for the Death of her Willye.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>9th Nov. Thomas Orwyn had license to print
“Martyn said to his man, Who is the foole now?”</p>

<p>This has been preserved for us, with its tune, by
Ravenscroft, in his “Deuteromelia.”</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>1591, 27th August. Robert Bourne obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
license to print a ballad on “A combat between a
man and his wife for the breeches.” This has been
often re-written.</p>

<p>1592, 5th Jan. Richard Jones, “The Valliant
Acts of Guy of Warwick,” to the tune of “Was ever
man soe tost (lost) in love?” The ballad of Guy is
lost. The tune we have.</p>

<p>1592, 18th Jan. H. Kyrkham, “The crowe she
sitteth upon a wall:” “Please one and please all.”
The former is, perhaps, the original of “The crow sat
in a pear-tree.” “Please one and please all” has
been preserved.</p>

<p>1592, 21st July. John Danter, “The soules good
morrowe.”</p>

<p>1592, 28th July. H Kyrkham, “The Nightingale’s
Good-night.”</p>

<p>1593, 1st Oct. Stephen Peel, “Betwixt life and
death,” to the tune of “Have with you into the
country.”</p>

<p>1594, 16th Oct. John Danter, “Jones’ ale is new.”
This is sung to the present day in village taverns.
One verse is roared forth with special emphasis. It
is that of the mason:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“He dashed his hammer against the wall;</div>
<div class="verse">He hoped both tower and church would fall;</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>1594, 16th Oct. E. White, “The Devil of Devonshire
and William of the West, his Sonne.” This is
lost.</p>

<p>1595, 14th Jan. Thomas Creede, “The Saylor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Joye,” to the tune of “Heigh-ho! hollidaie.” Both
ballad and air lost.</p>

<p>1595, 24th Feb. Thomas Creede, The first part of
“The Merchante’s Daughter of Bristole.” This we
have, but it is a recast in the sixteenth century of a
far earlier ballad.</p>

<p>1595, 15th Oct. Thomas Millington, “The Norfolk
Gentleman, his Will and Testament, and howe he
committed the keeping of his children to his owne
brother.” This&mdash;“The Babes in the Wood,” we
have, as well as the melody.</p>

<p>1595, 15th Oct. W. Blackwall, “The Prowde
Mayde of Plymouthe.” Lost.</p>

<p>1603, 11th June. Wm. White, “A Sweet Maie
Flower;” “The Ladie’s Fall;” “The Bryde’s
Buriell;” “The Spanish Ladie’s Love;” “The
Lover’s Promises to his Beloved;” “The Fayre
Lady Constance of Cleveland and of her Disloyal
Knight.”</p>

<p>We have “The Lady’s Fall” and the two that
follow. “A Sweet Mayflower” is probably a real
loss, as also the ballad of the Lady Constance and
her disloyal knight. This will suffice to show how
interesting are these records, and also how much has
perished, as well as how much is preserved. It must
not, however, be lost to mind that these were all new
ballads, and were serving to displace the earlier and
better ballads.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>Every accident, every murder, every battle was
turned into doggerel and printed as a new ballad.
Fourpence was the cost of a license.</p>

<p>In Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Philastes,” Megra
threatens the King&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“By all those gods you swore by, and as many</div>
<div class="verse">More of mine own&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The princess, your daughter, shall stand by me</div>
<div class="verse">On walls, and sung in ballads.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She refers to the manner in which every bit of
court scandal was converted into rhythmic jingle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
also to the custom of pasting the ballads on the walls.
The least acquaintance with the old black-letter
ballads will make the reader understand the allusion
to the two figures heading the broadside, in rude
woodcut, standing side by side.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the black-letter ballads were
of moral and religious import. In Beaumont and
Fletcher’s “The Coxcomb,” the tinker refers to
these, when he finds poor Viola wandering in the
streets at night, and listens to her doleful words. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What’s this? a prayer or a homily, or a ballad of good
counsel?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">If we compare the black-letter issues of the sixteenth
century with the snatches of ballads that come to us
through the playwrights, we find that they do not
wholly agree.</p>

<p>The dramatists made their characters sing the
folk-ballads, the same that are described in “A Defence
for Milksmaydes” in 1563.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“They rise in the morning to hear the larke sing,</div>
<div class="verse">And welcome with balletts the somer’s coming.</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb2" />

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In going to milking, or coming away,</div>
<div class="verse">They sing merry balletts, or storeys they say.</div>
<div class="verse">Their mouth is as pure and as white as their milk;</div>
<div class="verse">&mdash;You can not say that of your velvett and silke.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So the mad jailor’s daughter in Fletcher’s and
Shakespeare’s “The Two Noble Kinsmen.”</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She says: “Is not this a fine song?”</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Brother</i>: “Oh, a very fine one!”</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Daughter</i>: “I can say twenty more, I can sing <i>The Broom</i>
and <i>Bonny Robin</i>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">And she begins to troll “Oh fair! oh sweet!” etc.</p>

<p>Unhappily the authors of this play did not write out
the song, as it was too well known to require transcription,
and now it is lost. So also are those she
sings in another scene.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“The George alow came from the South,</div>
<div class="verse i2">From the Coast of Barbary-a!</div>
<div class="verse">And there we met with brave gallants of war,</div>
<div class="verse i2">By one, by two, by three-a!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“Well hail’d, well hail’d, you jolly gallants!</div>

<div class="verse">Or let me have your company</div>
<div class="verse i2">Till I come to the Sound-a!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">This sounds as though a part of the “Henry Martyn”
(Andrew Barton) already given. Another of the
mad girl’s songs is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There were three fools fell out about an howlet.</div>
<div class="verse i4">The one said ’twas an owl;</div>
<div class="verse i4">The other said nay.</div>
<div class="verse i4">The third he said it was a hawk,</div>
<div class="verse i4">And her bells were cut away.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">So also with some of the songs and ballads of
Ophelia. They were too well known to be printed,
and now they are irrecoverably gone.</p>

<p>We have lost nearly the whole of our earliest
ballad poetry, and only a tithe of that which took its
place has come down to us.</p>

<p>“Our earliest ballads,” says the editor of Percy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
folio, “though highly popular in the Elizabethan age,
were yet never collected into any collections, save in
Garlands, till the year 1723. They wandered up and
down the country without even sheepskins or goatskins
to protect them; they flew about like the birds of
the air, and sung songs dear to the hearts of the
common people&mdash;songs whose power was sometimes
confessed by the higher classes, but not so
thoroughly appreciated as to conduce them to exert
themselves for their preservation.”</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Anne and through the early
Hanoverian period, sheets of copperplate were issued
with engraved songs and ballads, together with their
music. Among them may be found a few&mdash;but only
a very few&mdash;of the old favourites. Most are compositions
of Arne, Carey, Berg, Dunn, etc., and the words
are quite unsuited to hold the attention of the
peasantry. Hardly any of these found their way
into broadsides and garlands, and none can now be
heard by the cottage fire or in the village ale-house.</p>

<p>In 1808, John Catnach of Newcastle settled in
London, and began to print broadsides. He was
quickly followed by others in London and in country
towns. Catnach kept a number of ballad-mongers in
his pay, who either composed verses for him or swept
up such traditional ballads as they chanced to hear.
They were paid half-a-crown for a copy, whether
original or adulterate. If one of these poetasters
chanced to hear an ancient ballad, he added to it
some of his own verses, so as to be able to call it his
property, and then disposed of it to one of the
broadside publishers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>If these men had been sent round the country to
collect from cottages and village hostelries, in the
way in which Wardour Street Jews send about into
every part of England to pick up old oak, then a
great amount of our traditional ballad poetry might
have been recovered. It was not too late in the first
ten or twenty years of this century. But this was
not done. These pot-poets loafed about in the low
London public-houses, where it was only by the
rarest chance that a country man, fresh from the
fields, and woods, and downs, with his memory laden
with the fragrance of the rustic music, was to be
found. Moreover, these fellows were overweening in
their opinion of their own powers. They had neither
taste, nor ear, nor genius. They poured forth floods
of atrocious rhymes, and of utter balderdash, as was
required, as an occasion offered, and as they stood in
need of half-crowns. Consequently the broadside
“white-letter” ballad no more represents the folk
ballad of the English people than does the black-letter
ballad.</p>

<p>Who that has a sprinkling of grey on his head
does not remember the ballad-singer at a fair, with
his or her yards of verse for sale? The ballad-seller,
who vended his broadsheets, did much to corrupt the
taste of the peasant. He had begun to read, and he
read the ha’penny broadside, and learned by heart
what he had bought; then he set it to some fine old
melody as ancient as the Wars of the Roses, and
sang it; and what is unfortunate, discarded the old
words for the sake of the vile stuff composed by the
half-tipsy, wholly-stupid band, in the pay of Ryle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Catnach, Harkness of Preston, Williams of Portsea,
Snidall of Manchester, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Hindley, in his “History of the Catnach Press,”
1886, gives an amusing account of his acquaintance
with John Morgan, the last surviving of Catnach’s
poets:&mdash;“Mr. John Morgan, full of bows and scrapes,
was ushered into our presence. ‘Take a seat, sir.’
‘Yes, sir, and thank you too,’ he replied, at the same
time sitting down, and then very carefully depositing
his somewhat dilapidated hat under&mdash;far under&mdash;the
chair. We then inquired whether he would have
anything to eat, or have a cup of coffee. No! it was
a little too early for eating, and coffee did not agree
with him. Or, a drop of good ‘Old Tom,’ we somewhat
significantly suggested. Mr. John Morgan
would very much like to have a little drop of gin, for
it was a nasty, raw, cold morning. In answer to our
inquiry whether he would prefer hot or cold water,
elected to have it neat, if it made no difference to us.</p>

<p>“Mr. John Morgan, at our suggestion, having ‘wet
the other eye,’ <i>i.e.</i>, taken the second glass, the real
business commenced thus:&mdash;‘We have been informed
that you were acquainted with, and used to write for,
the late James Catnach, who formerly lived in Seven
Dials, and that you can give us much information
that we require towards perfecting a work we have
in hand, treating on street literature.’ ... Here Mr.
Morgan expressed his willingness to give all the information
he could on the subject, and leave it to our
generosity to pay him what we pleased, and adding
that he had no doubt that we should not fall out on
that score. Mr. Morgan talked and took gin. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Morgan got warm&mdash;warmer, and warmer,&mdash;and very
entertaining. We continued to talk and take notes,
and Mr. Morgan talked and took gin, until he
emulated the little old woman who sold ‘Hot
Codlings,’ for of her it is related that, ‘The glass she
filled, and the bottle she shrunk, And this little old
woman in the end got&mdash;’</p>

<p>“At last it became very manifest that we should
not be able to get any more information out of Mr.
John Morgan on that day, so proposed for him to
call again on the morrow morning. Then having
presented him with a portrait of Her Most Gracious
Majesty, set in gold, we endeavoured to see him
downstairs, which, we observed, were very crooked;
Mr. Morgan thought they were very old and funny
ones....</p>

<p>“At length the wishful morrow came, also ten of
the clock, the hour appointed, but not so Mr. John
Morgan, nor did he call at any hour during the day.
But soon after eleven o’clock the next day he made
his appearance; but being so stupidly drunk we gave
him some money and told him to call again tomorrow.
And he did, but still so muddled that we
could make nothing out of him, and so curtly dismissed
him.”</p>

<p>Here are specimens of the sort of stuff turned out
for Catnach by John Morgan and the like. The first
is on the birth of the Princess Royal.</p>

cold and rain at the door of his beloved, and vowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he would not do it again. There is certainly a distance
of something beside two thousand years between
Horace and the gentleman who wrote the
above lines.</p>

<p>There is a really astonishing poem entitled
“The Lights of Asheaton,” which, happily, everyone
can purchase for a ha’penny. It is the composition
of a recent Irish poet of the same class as Mr. John
Morgan, and is a dissuasive against Protestantism.
What the “Lights” of Asheaton are does not transpire.
It opens thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“You Muses now aid me in admonishing Paganism,</div>
<div class="verse">The new Lights of Asheaton, whose fate I do deplore.</div>
<div class="verse">From innocence and reason they are led to condemnation,</div>
<div class="verse">Their fate they’ve violated, the occasion of their woe.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After some wonderful lines that we hardly like to
quote, as savouring of irreverence&mdash;though that was
far from the poet’s intention&mdash;he assures us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">“Waters will decrease most amazing to behold,</div>
<div class="verse">No fanatic dissenter, no solvidian (<i>sic</i>) cripple,</div>
<div class="verse">Dare them to dissemble, the truths for to relinquish,</div>
<div class="verse">For the enthusiast will tremble at the splendors of the Pope.”</div>

<p>The sheet of broadside ballad that is passing away
deserves a little attention before it disappears. It
reveals to us the quality of song that commended itself
to the uneducated. It shows us how the song
proper has steadily displaced the ballad proper. It is
surprising for what it contains, as well as for what it
omits. Apparently in the latter part of this century
the sole claim to admission is that words&mdash;no matter
what they be&mdash;should be associated to a taking air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
We find on the broadsheets old favourites of our
youth&mdash;songs by Balfe, and Shield, and Hudson; but
the Poet Laureate is unrepresented; even Dibdin
finds but grudging admission. When we look at the
stuff that is home-made, we find that it consists of
two sorts of production&mdash;one, the ancient ballad in
the last condition of wreck, cast up in fragments;
and the other, of old themes worked up over
and over again by men without a spark of poetic
fire in their hearts. A century or two hence we
shall have this rubbish collected and produced as
the folk song of the English peasantry, just as we
have had the black-letter ballads raked together and
given to the world as the ballad poetry of the
ancient English.</p>

<p>The broadside ballad is at its last gasp. Every
publisher in the country who was wont to issue these
ephemerides has discontinued doing so for thirty or
forty years. In London, in place of a score of publishers
of these leaves, there are but three&mdash;Mr. Fortey,
of Seven Dials; Mr. Such, of the Boro’; and Mr.
Taylor, of Bethnal Green. As the broadside dies, it
becomes purer. There are ballads in some of the
early issues of a gross and disgusting nature. These
have all had the knife applied to them, and nothing
issues from the press of Mr. Fortey, Mr. Such, and
Mr. Taylor which is offensive to good morals. Mr.
Such, happily, has all his broadsides numbered, and
publishes a catalogue of them; some of the earlier
sheets are, however, exhausted, and have not been
reprinted.</p>

<p>It is but a matter of a few years and the broadside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
will be as extinct as the Mammoth and the Dodo,
only to be found in the libraries of collectors. Already
sheets that fetched a ha’penny thirty years ago are
cut down the middle, and each half fetches a shilling.
The garlands are worth more than their weight in
gold. Let him that is wise collect whilst he may.</p>

<span class="old">Riddles</span>.</h2>


<p>There is a curious little work, the contents of which
are said to have been collected by Hans Sachs, the
Nuremberg cobbler and master-singer, in 1517. This
curious book was reprinted several times in the
seventeenth and early part of the eighteenth century,
but it is now somewhat scarce. It was issued without
place of publication or publisher’s name, in small
form without cover. The book pretends to have been
prepared by Hans Sachs for his private use, that he
might make merriment among his friends, when
drinking, and they were tired of his songs. It does
not contain any anecdotes; it is made up of a collection
of riddles more or less good, some coarse, and
some profane; but the age was not squeamish. The
title under which the little work was issued was, <i>Useful
Table-talk, or Something for all; that is the Happy
Thoughts, good and bad, expelling Melancholy and
cheering Spirits, of Hilarius Wish-wash, Master-tiler
at Kielenhausen</i>. The book consists of just a hundred
pages, of which a quarter are consumed by prefaces,
introductions, etc., and about thirteen filled with
postscript and index. The humours of the book are
somewhat curious; for instance, in the preliminary
index of subjects it gives&mdash;“IX. The reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
this book of Table-talk was so late in being published.”
When we turn to the place indicated for the
reason, we find a blank. There is no such reason.
There is a fulsome and absurd dedication to the
“Honourable and Knightly Tileburner” who lives
“By the icy ocean near Moscow, in Lapland, one
mile below Podolia and three miles above it.”</p>

<p>Although we are not told in the place indicated
why the little collection was not issued immediately
after the death of Hans Sachs, nor among his works,
we learn the reason elsewhere, in the preface, where
we are told that the jokes it contained were so good
that a rivalry ensued among them as to precedence,
and till this was settled, it was impossible to get the
book printed. The collection contains in all one
hundred and ninety-six riddles; among them is that
which gives the date of the book, and that in a
chronogram: “When was this book of Table-talk
drawn up? <i>Answer.</i> In IetzIg taVsenD fIInff
hVnDert sIbenzehenDen Iahr” (1517).</p>

<p>Here are some of the conundrums.&mdash;<i>Question.</i>
After Adam had eaten the forbidden fruit, did he
stand or sit down?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> Neither; he fell.</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> Two shepherds were pasturing their flocks.
Said one to the other: “Give me one of your sheep,
then I shall have twice as many sheep as you.”&mdash;“Not
so,” replied the second herdsman: “give me
one of yours, and then we shall have equal flocks.”
How many sheep had each?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> One had seven,
the other five. If the first took a sheep out of the
flock of the second, he had eight, the other four; if
the contrary, each had six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> What is four times six?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> 6666.</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> What does a goose do when standing on one
leg?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> Holds up the other!</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> When did carpenters first proclaim themselves
to be intolerable dawdles?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> When building the
Ark&mdash;they took a hundred years over it.</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> What sort of law is military law?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i>
Can(n)on law.</p>

<p>Some of the riddles have survived in the jocular
mouth to the present day; for instance, who does
not know this?&mdash;<i>Ques.</i> What smells most in an
apothecary’s shop?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> The nose. There is one
conundrum which surprises us. The story was wont
to be told by Bishop Wilberforce that he had asked a
child in Sunday School why the angels ascended and
descended on Jacob’s ladder, whereupon the child
replied that they did so because they were moulting,
and could not fly. But this appears in Hans Sachs’
book, and is evidently a very ancient joke indeed.</p>

<p>In this collection also appears the riddle:
“Which is heaviest, a pound of lead or a pound
of feathers?” which everyone knows, but with
an addition, which is an improvement. After the
answer, “Each weighs a pound, and they are equal in
weight,” the questioner says further: “Not so&mdash;try in
water. The pound of feathers will float, and the
pound of lead will sink.”</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> How can you carry a jug of water in your
hands on a broiling summer day, in the full blaze of
the sun, so that the water shall not get hotter?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i>
Let the water be boiling when you fill the jug.</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> How can a farmer prevent the mice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
stealing his corn?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> By giving them his
corn.</p>

<p><i>Ques.</i> A certain man left a penny by his will to be
divided equally among his fifty relatives, each to have
as much as the other, and each to be quite contented
with what he got, and not envy any of the other
legatees. How did the executor comply with this
testamentary disposition?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> He bought a packet
of fifty tin-tacks with the penny, and hammered one
into the back of each of the legatees.</p>

<p>There is another very curious old German collection
of riddles called <i>Æsopus Epulans</i>; but that
contains anecdotes as well and a great deal of very
interesting matter. This is a much larger volume,
and is the commonplace book of a party of priests
who used to meet at each other’s houses to smoke,
and drink, argue, and joke. One of the members
took down the particulars of conversation at each
meeting, and published it. A most curious and
amusing volume it is. Some of the conundrums the
old parsons asked each other were the same as those
in Hans Sachs’ collection; they had become traditional.
We may safely say that none were better,
and some were, if possible, more pointless. They
have all much the same character: they resemble
faintly the popular conundrum of the type so widely
spread, and so much affected still by nurses and
by the labouring class, and which so often begins
with “London Bridge is broken down,” or, “As
I went over London Bridge.” These are very
ancient. We have analogous riddles among those
which Oriental tradition puts into the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Queen of Sheba when she “proved Solomon with hard
questions.” Mr. Kemble published for the Ælfric
Society a collection of questions and answers that
exist in Anglo-Saxon as a conversation between
Solomon and Saturn, and numerous versions existed
in the Middle Ages of the dialogue between Solomon
and&mdash;as the answerer was often called&mdash;Markulf.
But these questions only partially correspond with
our idea of riddles.</p>

<p>A more remarkable collection is that in the Icelandic
<i>Herverar Saga</i>, where the King Heidrek
boasts of his power to solve all riddles. Then Odin
visits him in disguise as a blind man, and propounds
to the king some hard questions. Of these there are
sixty-four. We will give a few specimens. <i>Ques.</i>
What was that drink I drank yesterday, which was
neither spring water, nor wine, nor mead, nor ale?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i>
The dew of heaven. <i>Ques.</i> What dead lungs
did I see blowing to war?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> A blacksmith’s
bellows whilst a sword was being forged. <i>Ques.</i>
What did I see outside a great man’s door, head
downwards, feet heavenwards?&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> An onion.</p>

<p>These riddles are all in verse, and the replies also
in verse. The end was that Odin asked Heidrek
what he, Odin, whispered into the ear of Baldur
before he was burned on his funeral pyre. Thereupon
Heidrek drew his sword and cut at his questioner,
shouting: “None can answer that but yourself!”
Odin had just time to transform himself
into an eagle; but the sword shore off his tail, and
eagles ever after have had short tails.</p>

<p>The Sphinx will recur to the recollection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
reader, who tore to pieces those who could not
answer its riddles. At last Creon, King of Thebes,
offered his sister, Jocasta, to anyone who could solve
the enigmas propounded by the Sphinx. Œdipus
ventured, and when asked by the monster, “What
animal is four-footed in the morning, two-footed at
noon, and three-footed in the evening?” answered:
“Man, who as a babe crawls, and as an old man leans
on a crutch.” The Sphinx was so distressed at
hearing its riddle solved, that it precipitated itself
from a precipice and was dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>The Persian hero, Sal, who was brought up by the
gigantic bird Simorg, appears before Mentuscher,
Schah of Iran. The latter, forewarned that Sal will
be a danger to him, endeavours to get rid of him.
However, he first tests him with hard questions. If
he answers these, he is to be allowed to live. The
first question is: “There stand twelve cypresses in a
ring, and each bears thirty boughs.” Sal replies,
“These are the twelve months, each of which has
thirty days.” Another question is&mdash;“There were two
horses, one black, the other clear as crystal.” “They
are Day and Night,” replied Sal.</p>

<p>In English and Scottish Ballads a whole class
has reference to the importance of riddle answering.</p>

<p>A girl is engaged to a young man who dies. He
returns from the grave and insists on her fulfilling
her engagement to him and following him to the
land of the dead. She consents on one condition,
that he will answer her riddles, or else she pleads to
be spared, and the dead lover agrees on condition
that she shall answer some riddles he sets. Such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a ballad which was formerly enacted in the farmhouses
in Cornwall. The girl sits on her bed and
sighs for her dead lover. He reappears and insists
on her following him. Then she sets him tasks, and
he sets her tasks.</p>

<p>Those he sets her are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Thou must buy me, my lady, a cambrick shirt</div>
<div class="verse i2">Whilst every grove rings with a merry antine (antienne = anthem),</div>
<div class="verse">And stitch it without any needle work,</div>
<div class="verse i2">O, and thou shalt be a true love of mine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“And thou must wash it in yonder well</div>
<div class="verse">Where never a drop of water fell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse ic">“And thou must hang it upon a white thorn</div>
<div class="verse">That never has blossomed since Adam was born.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Those she sets him are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Thou must buy for me an acre of land</div>
<div class="verse">Between the salt ocean and the yellow sand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">“Thou must plough it over with a horse’s horn,</div>
<div class="verse">And sow it all over with one pepper corn.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">“Thou must reap it too with a piece of leather,</div>
<div class="verse">And bind the sheaf with a peacock’s feather.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“In all stories of this kind,” says Mr. Child, in his
monumental work on English Ballads, “the person
upon whom a task is imposed stands acquitted if
another of no less difficulty is desired, which must be
performed first.”</p>

<p>An early form of this story is preserved in the
<i>Gesta Romanorum</i>. A king resolved not to marry a
wife till he could find the cleverest of women. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
length a poor maid was brought to him, and he
made trial of her sagacity. He sent her a bit of
linen three inches square, and promised to marry her,
if out of it she could make him a shirt. She stipulated
in reply that he should send her a vessel in
which she could work. We have here only a mutilated
fragment of the series of tasks set. In an
old English ballad in the Pepysian library, an Elfin
knight visits a pretty maid, and demands her in
marriage.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“‘Thou must shape a sark to me</div>
<div class="verse">Without any cut or heme,’ quoth he.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Thou must shape it knife-and-sheerless</div>
<div class="verse">And also sue it needle-threadless.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“I have an aiker of good ley-land</div>
<div class="verse">Which lyeth low by yon sea-strand.</div>
<div class="verse">For thou must car it with thy horn,</div>
<div class="verse">So thou must sow it with thy corn,</div>
<div class="verse">And bigg a cart of stone and lyme.</div>
<div class="verse">Robin Redbreast he must trail it hame,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou must barn it in a mouse-holl,</div>
<div class="verse">And thrash it into thy shoes sole.</div>
<div class="verse">And thou must winnow it in thy looff,</div>
<div class="verse">And also sech it in thy glove.</div>
<div class="verse">For thou must bring it over the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou must bring it dry home to me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the Elfin knight cannot fulfil these tasks, the
girl is not obliged to follow him to Elfin Land.
There is another song, known in a fragmentary condition
all through England:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Cold blows the wind to-night, sweetheart,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Cold are the drops of rain.</div>
<div class="verse">The very first love that ever I had</div>
<div class="verse i2">In greenwood he was slain.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The maiden being engaged to the dead man can
obtain no release from him till he restores to her her
freedom. She goes and sits on his grave and weeps.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“A twelvemonth and a day being up,</div>
<div class="verse i2">The ghost began to speak;</div>
<div class="verse">Why sit you here by my grave side</div>
<div class="verse i2">From dusk till dawning break?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“O think upon the garden, love,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Where you and I did walk;</div>
<div class="verse">The fairest flower that blossomed there</div>
<div class="verse i2">Is withered on its stalk.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ghost says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“What is it that you want of me,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And will not let me sleep?</div>
<div class="verse">Your salten tears they trickle down</div>
<div class="verse i2">My winding sheet to steep.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She replies that she has come to return his kisses
to him, so as to be off with her engagement. To this
the dead man replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Cold are my lips in death, sweetheart,</div>
<div class="verse i2">My breath is earthy strong,</div>
<div class="verse">If you do touch my clay-cold lips,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Your time will not be long.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then comes a divergence in the various forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
ballad assumes. Its most common form is for the
ghost to insist on her coming into his grave, unless
she can perform certain tasks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Go fetch me a light from dungeon deep,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Wring water from a stone,</div>
<div class="verse">And likewise milk from a maiden’s breast</div>
<div class="verse i2">Which never babe hath none.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She strikes a spark from a flint, she squeezes an
icicle, and she compresses the stalk of a dandelion or
“Johnswort.” So she accomplishes the tasks set
her.</p>

<p>Then the ghost exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Now if you had not done these things,</div>
<div class="verse i2">If you had not done all three,</div>
<div class="verse">I’d tear you as the withered leaves</div>
<div class="verse i2">Are torn from off the tree.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the maiden, released from her bond, sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Now I have mourned upon his grave</div>
<div class="verse i2">A twelvemonth and a day,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll set my sail before the wind</div>
<div class="verse i2">To waft me far away.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another ballad of the same class is that of the
knight who betrays a maiden, and refuses to marry
her unless she can answer certain riddles. These
are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“What is louder than a horn?</div>
<div class="verse">And what is sharper than a thorn?</div>
<div class="verse">What is broader than the way?</div>
<div class="verse">And what is deeper than the sea?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>


<p>The answers are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Thunder is louder than a horn,</div>
<div class="verse">And hunger is sharper than a thorn,</div>
<div class="verse">Love is broader than the way,</div>
<div class="verse">And hell is deeper than the sea.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now these ballads and a crowd of folk tales that
bear on the same point show plainly enough that
there was a time when quite as certainly as there
were contests of arms, so contests of wit were gone
through for great ends, sometimes with life at stake.
That was a period when there was a struggle between
man and man, and the fittest survived; but this
fittest was not always the strongest animal, but the
man of keenest wit. I do not know how else to
explain the universality of these legends. The riddle
is an amusement at the present day. It was an amusement
at a Greek banquet, as we learn from Plutarch.
But in a pre-historic period&mdash;in a mythic epoch&mdash;it
was something very grave. He or she who could not
solve a riddle, or a succession of riddles, forfeited life
or honour.</p>

<p>There are two of the earliest extant rhymes of the
Norse people which hinge on the same idea, and
in them the gods themselves have their existence or
honour at stake. These are the Vafthrudnis Mâl and
the Alvis Mâl, in the Elder Edda.</p>

<p>In the first of these Odin the god and mythical
ancestor of the Scandinavian race visits the Jute, the
giant Vafthrudnir, representative of the large-sized
pre-historic race which occupied Scandinavia, Great
Britain, and Gaul. They go through a contest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
wit. He who is defeated in this trial of skill has to
lose his life.</p>

<p>Vafthrudnir asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Tell me, Gagnrad,</div>
<div class="verse">Since on the floor thou wilt</div>
<div class="verse">Prove thy proficiency,</div>
<div class="verse">How is the horse called</div>
<div class="verse">That draws each day</div>
<div class="verse">Forth over mankind?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Odin, who has called himself Gagnrad, replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Skinfaxi he is named</div>
<div class="verse">That the bright day draws</div>
<div class="verse">Forth over mankind.</div>
<div class="verse">Of horses is he highest esteemed</div>
<div class="verse">Amidst the Reid-Goths,</div>
<div class="verse">Light ever streams from that horse’s mane.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Next comes the question relative to the black horse
of night. Then as to the stream that divides the
Jutes from the Æsir (the Scandinavians). Then as
to the name of the plain on which the great final
fight will take place, in which the light of the gods
will be quenched. And so on. The giant is overcome.
This song is interesting because it is a poetic
representation of an historic event, the conquest of
the Jute by the Scandinavian, not so much by force
of arms, as by superior mental sagacity.</p>

<p>The other song in the Edda is the prototype of all
the Elfin Knight and analogous ballads in which a
being of the under world, now an elf, then a devil,
then a dead man, seeks to win to himself a maiden of
the upper world, and of the dominant race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The dwarf Alvis, who lives under the earth and
under stones, <i>i.e.</i>, in a beehive hut, a representative
of the pre-historic, small, short-headed, metal-working
race, has somehow extorted a promise from the god
Thorr, that he will give him his daughter, the “fair-bright,

doing this, but is reminded of his promise. We do
not know the particulars, but in all probability the
dwarf Alvis had fashioned for him his hammer, and had
received the promise in return. Thorr at last yields,
but only on condition that Alvis shall solve a series
of riddles, or rather answer a number of questions
as to the various names given to sun, moon, wind,
sky, etc.</p>

<p>The last question asked is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">How beer is called</div>
<div class="verse">Which the sons of men</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Alvis answers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Ale</i> is it called by men,</div>
<div class="verse">By the Æsir <i>Beer</i>,</div>

<p>It is deserving of note that in all these early
accounts of riddle-setting, the <i>forfeit</i> is either life or
honour. We have instances of riddle-setting as a
test before marriage, or what is the same thing, the
setting difficult tasks to be accomplished&mdash;something
to prove the wit of the young woman. Unless she were
“up to mark” in wit, she was held to be unfit for the
marriage proposed. In one folk tale a girl is given
straw to spin into gold, grains to collect and count.
In Cupid and Psyche, the fair seeker after her divine
lover is set tasks by Venus, without the accomplishment
of which she cannot win him. In many a tale
a prince is set tasks, without the accomplishment of
which he cannot be accepted as lover for the daughter
and heiress of a king.</p>

<p>In the saga of Ragnar Lodbrog, the King bids
Aslaug come to him clothed yet naked, accompanied
yet alone, fed yet empty. She complies by casting
off her garments but covering herself with her golden
hair that flows to her feet, taking with her a dog
only, and chewing a blade of garlic. Satisfied with
her wit, Ragnar marries her. She became by him the
mother of five sons, one of whom was the ancestor of
Harald Fairhair, who made Norway into one realm
under his sceptre. Aslaug was the daughter of
Sigurd and Brunhild, made familiar to us through
Wagner’s “Ring of the Nibelungen.”</p>

<p>The forfeits of a child’s game of the present day, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
stand in the corner on one leg, to call up the chimney,
to kiss everyone in the room&mdash;are the faintest ghostly
reminiscences of the terrible forfeit, which, in the
mythic age of mankind, had to be paid by the man
or woman who became liable through lack of shrewdness
in the great contest of wit. The man who did
not solve the riddle lost his life. The woman who
failed to answer the questions had to leave her race,
suffer social death, and pass over to the realm of the
conquered race.</p>

<p>I repeat it, it is quite impossible to explain the stories
of riddle-setting which appear as a matter of most serious
import as they come to us out of a remote antiquity,
and from every part of Europe and Asia, unless we hold
that there were in a pre-historic age these contests of
wit for the highest stakes, just as there were holm-gangs,
duels, like those of David and Goliath, of the
Horatii and Curiatii, of Herakles and Geryon.</p>

<p>But the existence of the riddle and of the forfeit attaching
to inability to answer the riddle, does not, we
may be sure, begin with such cases as the contest of
Odin and Vafthrudnir, Thorr and Alvis, Œdipus and
Sphinx. As it appears thus in myth, it is a survival
of a still earlier condition of affairs.</p>

<p>At the present day throughout Europe, nurses ask
children riddles, and very often a forfeit attaches to
inability to answer them. This points to the riddle
as a means of education of the young mind, but also
as a test of its powers. In legend and myth it does
not appear as educative, but as a test of mental
power. How came it to be a test?</p>

<p>We know that among certain races in a primitive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
even in a cultivated condition, the feeble and halt
children are cast forth to perish. It was so with the
Greeks and Romans, it was so with the Norse, it has
been so in every ancient race. I cannot but suspect,
from the many indications given by tradition, that the
riddle was employed at one time as a brain test.
That not only were the physically weak cast out,
but also the mentally incapable.</p>

<p>The most startling reminiscence of the old ordeal
of brains is that of the Wartburg Contest in 1206 or
1207, under the Landgrave Hermann. The poem of
the “Kriec von Wartburg” was not indeed composed
till a century later, but that only makes it the more
astonishing. It represents the minnesingers under
the Landgrave contesting in song and riddle, and
those who are defeated forfeit <i>life</i>. Christian
knights and ladies could look on at a tourney
in the lists with life at stake, and Christian knights
and ladies in the fourteenth century thought it by
no means a monstrous thing that he who could
not answer a riddle should submit his neck to the
executioner’s sword. Such a condition of ideas is only
conceivable as a heritage from a past when men had
to show that they had an intellectual as well as a
physical qualification to live among their fellow-men.</p>

<p>The riddle has gone into an infinity of forms.
A German writer<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> sets to work to analyse its various
manifestations. There is the numerical riddle, the
conundrum, the logogryph, the charade, the rebus,
the picture puzzle, the epigram, and so forth. Its
last transformation is the novel of the type of Wilkie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Collins’ “Moonstone,” in which the brain of the
reader is kept in tension throughout, and the imagination
at work to discover the solution of the question&mdash;Who
stole the moonstone? A German poet, who
cannot have thought much on the matter, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“The riddle, charade, and all of that ilk,</div>
<div class="verse">Are the bacon and beans of small brains.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the riddle and the forfeit have had to do with
the development of mankind, the killing out of the
witless, and the survival of the intelligent. As the
young were tested whether strong enough to live and
by brute force to hold their own, so, apparently, at a
remote period in man’s history the brains of the
young were passed through ordeal, and those who
lacked readiness were also cast out as profitless.</p>

<p>That was the first stage&mdash;and that is one which
we conjecture that man passed through; we have
no direct evidence that it was so. Then came
the second, in which a trial of strength or of
wit determined great issues. Lastly, the riddle degenerated
into a mere pastime. But as a pastime
it remains to us a monument of great interest
and of great antiquity. In every railway station in
Germany is a measure. He who is below that mark
is unprofitable for Fatherland and rejected from
military service. The riddle was this mark before
history dawned. Only such as were mentally
capable of solving a simple question were considered
worthy to be enrolled in the family or tribe. As in
Germany at the present day, the lad who cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
pass the examination loses all chance of the short
military service to which the man of culture is
entitled, and is subjected to the long service of
a common country lout, and the fact of his failure
closes to him all professions, so was it in the
primeval world. He who could not pass through his
examination in riddles was condemned, if not to lose
his life, at least to lose caste, and the consciousness
that each lad must pass through this mental test
served to sharpen intelligences, and so conduced to
the advancement of mankind.</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI.<br />
<span class="old">The Gallows</span>.</h2>


<p>Among our national institutions there is one&mdash;the
gallows&mdash;to the roots of which, in a remote past,
antiquarians have, to the best of my knowledge,
not dug, and which they have not laid bare. Possibly
this omission is due to the fact that it is not
an institution of which we are proud; possibly also
to the fact that it is an institution which we keep as
clear from touching as we well can.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the origin and original signification
of the gallows are too curious to be neglected. The
origin is, moreover, so remote that unless it were
pointed out it would be wholly unsuspected.</p>

<p>In France and in Germany the wheel has occupied
the place in the history of crime which the gibbet has
taken with us; and the wheel, as I shall presently
show, has as old and significant an origin.</p>

<p>We know pretty exactly the date of the introduction
of this institution into our island; we owe it,
along with our ale and our constitutional government,
to the Anglo-Saxon invaders.</p>

<p>There were no gallows in Britain under the Celts.
The kingdom of Kent was founded in 449, and it was
then that the gallows first made their appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
among us; and from the Isle of Thanet spread over
the whole land.</p>

<p>The great god of the conquering races, who invaded
Britain and subdued the Britons, was Woden, who
has given his name to Wednesday; and this god
with one eye had a double aspect. He was god of
the air, the wind, and he was also god of the sun.
According to the etymology of his name, he was the
god of the gale, and the source of all breath; but his
one fiery eye was most certainly the sun; and he was
represented holding a wheel of gold, and that golden
wheel symbolised the sun. The Gauls also had
a sun god, representations of whom holding a wheel
have been discovered in France in considerable
numbers; and, unquestionably, when Goths, Burgundians,
and Franks invaded Gaul, or swept over it,
their sun god and the Gallic wheel-bearing god were
identified.</p>

<p>But those who thought of and adored Woden as
god of the wind thought nothing of the wheel.
Woden was a cruel deity, who demanded sacrifices;
and the sacrifices he required were human.</p>

<p>In the Elder Edda, a collection of very ancient
songs relating to the Norse gods and heroes, who
were the same as the gods and heroes of our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers, is one mysterious poem, supposed
to be sung by Odin (Woden) himself as he hangs in
the world-tree, a self-immolated victim, between
heaven and earth for nine nights.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“I knew that I hung</div>
<div class="verse">In the wind-rocked tree</div>
<div class="verse">Nine whole nights,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Wounded with a spear;</div>
<div class="verse">And to Odin offered</div>
<div class="verse">Myself to myself,</div>
<div class="verse">On that tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Of which no one knows</div>
<div class="verse">From what root it springs.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As he thus hangs, himself the sacrifice offered to
himself as god, he composes a song of twice nine
runes, and the result of the twelfth is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“If on a tree I see</div>
<div class="verse">A corpse swinging by a halter,</div>
<div class="verse">I can so grave runes</div>
<div class="verse">And them write</div>
<div class="verse">That that man shall with me</div>
<div class="verse">Walk and converse.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="uni">That is to say, every victim hung on a tree becomes
one of Odin’s band, with whom he rides in the storm
blast over the earth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the myth connected with this curious
poem is not preserved; but we can gather so
much from it, that Odin was said to have immolated
himself to himself by hanging in the world-tree, and
that thenceforth he claimed all men who had been
hung as members of his band.</p>

<p>In one of the early Norse sagas we have a story
about a king called Vikarr, who desired to dedicate
himself to the god, and so he had a gallows erected
before his palace, and got a friend to fasten a halter
round his neck and hang him on the gallows. Another
tells of a woman who, to gain her husband’s
love, hung her son to the god to obtain his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
assistance so as to brew a good vat of ale. At
Lethra, in Denmark, every nine years ninety-nine
men, and as many horses, were hung in honour
of the god; and at Upsala numerous human
victims swung by the neck about the image of Odin.
After their great victory over the Romans the Cymbri
and Teutons hung all their captives as a thank-offering
to their gods; and after the slaughter of the
legions of Varus the horses of the Romans were
found hung on the trees on the scene of defeat.</p>

<p>Indeed, one of the names of Odin was the Hanging
God, either because he hung himself, or because
he had victims hung to him.</p>

<p>The world-tree, the great tree in which he hung,
the tree which supports heaven and earth, was called
Yggdrasil, which means Ogre’s horse, for one of the
names of Odin was Yggr or Ogre, to express his love
of human sacrifices; and all the old nursery tales and
rhymes concerning ogres have reference to this great
god of the English people. Jack mounts the beanstalk,
and above the clouds enters the land of the
Ogre, with his one eye, who devours men. Jack the
Giant Killer, who lives in Cornwall, represents the
British Christian fighting against the Pagan Saxon,
impersonated as the great man-eating ogre.</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“Fee-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.</div>
<div class="verse">Whether he be alive, or whether he be dead,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this again we have a reference to Woden or
Odin, who was also called the Miller; for the mutter
or roll of the thunder was supposed to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
working of his quern, grinding up his human victims
for his meal.</p>

<p>Originally, victims were either freewill offerings, or
were chosen from among the best in the land. So
we hear of a Norse king every ten years sacrificing
one of his sons, and of the Swedes, in time of famine,
sacrificing their king, but it became general to offer
the prisoners taken in war, and when these lacked,
to sacrifice those who lay in prison condemned for
crimes.</p>

<p>In one of the Norse sagas, we are told of a king’s
daughter that, on hearing of the death of her father
in battle, she went to the valley dedicated to the
gods and there hung herself. Her father, having
died in battle, went to Walhalla to Odin, and her
only chance of being with him in the spirit world was
to hang herself to the honour of Odin, who would
then receive her among his elect, and so associate
her with her father. If she were to die in her bed,
she would go down to the nether world of Hela.</p>

<p>It is curious that in the West of England there
are fields, generally situated in lonely spots, that go
by the name of gallows’-traps, and the popular saying
concerning them is that whoever sets foot in them is
predestined to die on the gibbet. The probable
origin of this superstition is that these were actual
traps for the unwary, in which to catch victims for
sacrifice.</p>

<p>In certain districts a parcel of land was set apart
to the god, and it was agreed that whosoever set
foot on it should be sacrificed. Usually this was a
stranger, unaware of the sacredness of the ground he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
trod. He was seized and hung to Woden. We
cannot say for certain that this is the origin of the
gallows-traps, but it is the most probable explanation
of their origin, and of the superstitious dread of
them still existing among the people.</p>

<p>In France and Germany the wheel was used
as the instrument of death as frequently as the
gallows; those executed on the wheel were set upon
poles, the wheel horizontal, and their broken limbs
intertwined among the spokes. Originally they were
thus put to death as oblations to the sun-god, whose
symbol was the wheel. Little by little the idea of
sacrifice in these executions disappeared. When
Germans, Franks, and Anglo-Saxons became Christian,
human sacrifices ceased as a matter of course,
but as it was still necessary to put malefactors to
death, the same kind of death was adjudged to
them as before Christianity was professed. The
gradual process whereby human sacrifices were
changed in the classic world is well known to us.
At first every victim was a freewill offering, and even
a beast was obliged to appear so. To make the ox
seem to consent to its despatch, drops of oil or water
were put into its ears, that it might nod and shake its
head. Prisoners taken in war, then criminals, were
substituted for persons voluntarily devoting themselves
to death to the honour of the gods. When
it came to the execution of criminals, the idea of
sacrifice readily evaporated.</p>

<p>One remarkable fact remains to be noticed. In
all religions the sacrifice becomes identified with the
god to whom it is offered, and partakes of his powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether this be a mere confusion of ideas, or
whether there is some logical process at the bottom,
we will not stop to consider, but it remains a fact
everywhere. The victim is always thought to become
invested with some of the attributes of the god.</p>

<p>Now a whole series of superstitions exists connected
with men hung; and an executioner till of
late years derived a small revenue from the sale
of the cord, or other articles connected with
the criminal who had been hung, and these relics
were preserved, not out of a morbid love of
horrors, but out of a real belief that they were
beneficial, that they brought with them protection
against accidents and ailments. I remember, not
ten years ago, being shown by a woman, by no
means in the lowest walks of life, a small object in a
frame. This she said was a bit of the skin of a
certain famous murderer, for which she had given a
guinea.</p>

<p>“And what on earth makes you preserve it?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied the woman, “the house will never
catch fire so long as that is in it.”</p>

<p>The mutilation of bodies hung in chains was of
frequent occurrence in former times, on account of
like beliefs. The hands and feet and hair of the
dead were cut off. The former were constantly taken
by thieves and burglars, who believed that the hand
of the man hung would enable him to open any lock,
and enter any house with immunity.</p>

<p>The plunder of the gallows was sought in the first
days of Christianity in England by those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
still Pagans at heart, and desired to put themselves
under the protection of the old gallows god, Woden,
but the original meaning of this robbery of the
dead soon faded away, and the practice remained
without explanation.</p>

<p>Our word gallows is compound. The old word is
<i>galz</i>, and gallows means the <i>low</i> or mound of the
gibbet, and we speak of the gallow-tree, or the wood
on the gibbet hill. When we remember that the
gallows on which Odin hung is called Ogre’s horse, it
is interesting to note a popular riddle asked children
in Yorkshire. “What is the horse that is ridden
that never was foaled, and rid with a bridle that
never had bit?” The answer is&mdash;The Gallows. A
German name for it is the raven’s stone, not only,
perhaps, because ravens come to it, but because the
raven was the sacred bird of Odin.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to the wheel.</p>

<p>On the Continent, in Germany and in France, breaking
on the wheel was a customary
mode of execution. The victim was
stretched on the wheel, and with a
bar of iron his limbs were broken,
and then a blow was dealt him across
the breast. After that the wheel was
set up on a tall pole, with the dead
man on it, and left to become the
prey to the ravens.</p>

<p>This was a survival of human sacrifices
to the sun-god, as hanging is a
survival of human sacrifices to the
wind-god.</p>

<p>With regard to the solar-wheel, a great deal of very

Gaidoz.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He points out that in the museums of France
there are a good many monuments that represent
the sun-wheel along with
the thunderbolt as the
symbol of Jupiter, that
is to say, the old Gaulish
solar-god identified
with the Roman deity,
Jupiter. Gaulish warriors
wore a wheel on their
helmets&mdash;a wheel was a
favourite symbol as a
personal ornament, or perhaps as an amulet. The
wheel-window in a Gothic minster derives from the
solar-wheel.</p>

<p>When Constantine led his legions against Maxentius,
he professed to have seen a sign in the heavens,
and he believed it to be a token of Christ’s assistance.
What he really saw was a mock-sun. He adopted
and adapted the sign for his standards, and the
<i>Labarum</i> of Constantine became a common Christian
symbol. That there was policy in his conduct we
can hardly doubt; the symbol he set up gratified the
Christians in his army on one side, and the Gauls on
the other. To the former it was a sign compounded
of the initial letters of Christ, to the latter it was the
token of the favour of their solar deity. An addition
Constantine certainly made to the six-rayed wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
but it was not one that materially affected its
character.</p>

<p>Among the Sclavonic races in like

worshipped with symbols precisely the
same.</p>

<p>The solar god of the Sclaves was
Swanto Wit or Swato Wit, <i>i.e.</i>, Holy
Light. The sun was the chief god of the Sclaves,
and as the cock crows before sunrise and announces
the coming day, the cock was regarded
as sacred to the god, and sacrificed to it. The
worship of this god consisted in circular dances,
called <i>kolos</i>, and the dance was taken to represent the
revolution of the planets, the constellations, the
seasons about the sun. An old writer says of the
dances of Swanto Wit that they were celebrated
annually on the feast of St. John the Baptist, that is,
on Midsummer Day. “Benches are placed in a
circle, and these are leaped over by those who take
part in the rite. No one is allowed to be present
dressed in red. The entire month that precedes
St. John’s Day, the votaries are in an excited condition,
and in carrying on their dances they fall a prey to
nervous terrors.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Another writer tells us that they
swung about a fiery wheel in their dances, a symbol of
the solar disc.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In the Bavarian highlands, where the mountain
names are many of them of Sclavonic origin, and
testify to a Sclavonic race having occupied the Alps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
this is still customary. The midsummer dances,
and the whirling of fiery wheels, are still in
vogue. It is the same elsewhere. A writer on the
customs of the Sclaves says: “They give each other
a hand, and form a circle, whence the name of the
dance, kolo = a circle, or wheel. They take three
quick steps or leaps to the left, then a slow stride to
the right; but when men alone dance it, after the
three quick steps, they stand, and kick with the right
leg into the middle of the circle. When the dance is
accompanied by singing, one portion of the circle
sings one strophe, and the other repeats it. The
Sclave dance is most wild; and the same is found
among the Carinthians and the Croats.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In Dalmatia
and Croatia, on St. Vitus’ Day the peasants
dance, holding burning pieces of fragrant wood in
their hands.</p>

<p>In the reign of Pepin, the father of Charlemagne,
the Abbot Fulrad obtained the relics of St. Vitus, a
boy-martyr, from Rome, and conveyed them to
St. Denis. When the Abbey of New Corbey was
founded in Saxony, Warin, the abbot, wrote to
Hilduin of St. Denis, to entreat the gift of these relics
for his church. Accordingly, in 836, they were conveyed
to their new resting-place in Saxony. In 879,
the monks of Corbey started on a mission to the
Sclaves in Rügen and Pomerania, carrying with them
a portion of the relics of St. Vitus. They erected a
chapel in Rügen, which they dedicated to the saint.
The attempt failed; and when, later, the Rugians
were converted, the missionaries supposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the Swanto Wit, whom they found them worshipping,
was this very St. Vitus, in Sclave
Swante Vit, whose relics had been laid in Rügen.
When, in 1124, Otto, Bishop of Bamberg, laboured
for the conversion of the Pomeranians, he took with
him a figure of a cock and a silver arm that contained
bones of St. Vitus. The Pomeranians reverenced the
cock as a sacred being, and when Otto appeared
before them, holding up the cock and the silver arm,
they prostrated themselves to the cock, and he was
gratified at having thus inveigled them into doing
honour to the relics of St. Vitus.</p>

<p>Saint Wenceslas, Prince of Bohemia, in 930
destroyed the temple of Swanto Wit at Prague, and
erected on its site a church to Swante Vit, <i>i.e.</i>, St.
Vitus.</p>

<p>When Ancona was besieged by the Christian host
under Waldemar I., a prophecy circulated that the
city would fall into their hands on St. Vitus’ Day.
So it did, and Waldemar at once destroyed the
temple of Swanto Wit in the city, and on its ruins
erected a church to Swante Vit.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that in Sclavonic lands the
<i>cultus</i> of St. Vitus usurped the worship of the sun-god.
But to return to the dances. As we have seen,
the solar dances held in honour of Swanto Wit were
held an entire month. St. Vitus’ Day falls on June
15th, very near to Midsummer Day, and as these
dances continued in Christian times, and St. Vitus
had taken the place of the sun-god, they acquired his
name; they were called the dances of St. Vitus.</p>

<p>In 1370 an epidemic of chorœa broke out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Germany, especially along the valley of the Rhine.
Young people of both sexes were the victims; they
danced, jerked, and fell into hysterical convulsions.
Those who saw them were affected in like manner.
The phenomenon so much resembled the annual St.
Vitus’ dances that the disorder thenceforth took as its
special designation, “St. Vitus’ Dance.”</p>

<p>Dancing in a circle was a piece of sacred ritual
in honour of the revolving wheel of the sun. In the
Bavarian highlands at Midsummer a fiery wheel is
waved and rolled down the mountain sides. The
same sort of rite was anciently observed at the same
time in England. A monk of Winchelscombe, in the
reign of Henry VI., gives an account of the popular
festivals in his time. He speaks of three sorts of
amusements that take place on the vigil of St. John
the Baptist. One of these is the whirling of a cart
wheel. Another writer of the following century, in
his poem, “Regnum papisticum,” gives further details.
He says that the country people take an old wheel,
surround it with straw, so as completely to cover it,
and carry it to a height. At nightfall they set it on
fire and roll it down; a monstrous sight, he adds, and
one would believe that the sun was rolling down out
of heaven.</p>

<p>Exactly the same usage is, or was, common in
Belgium. In a charter, by which the Abbess of
Epinal ceded a wood to the magistrates of that town
in 1505, she made provision that every year, as an
acknowledgment, they should furnish “The Wheel of
Fortune, and the straw wherewith to cover it.”</p>

<p>Pages might be crowded with illustrations. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
refer the curious to the treatise of M. Gaidoz. Sufficient
evidence has been collected that the wheel was
the sacred symbol of the sun among the Gauls, the
Teutons, and the Sclaves. We can, therefore, see
how that an execution on the wheel was in its
original conception a sacrifice to the sun.</p>

<p>Long after this was forgotten the wheel remained,
as has the gallows with us, as the instrument for the
execution of criminals. In Germany, even in cases
of decapitation, the person executed was placed on a
wheel and his head on a pole, when separated from
the body. The last instances of breaking on the
wheel were in the first forty years of this century.
The fact of the use of the wheel as a means of execution
continuing so many hundreds of years after the
worship of the sun-god had ceased, and of the gallows
with us, for the same purpose, is a very curious and
instructive illustration of the persistence of customs
of which the original significance is absolutely lost.</p>

<span class="old">Holes</span>.</h2>


<p>In the village churchyard where as a boy I often
played, is a tomb, built up to the height of about five
feet, with a slate slab let into the south face, on
which is an inscription. In this slab is a hole, and
it used to be said
among the village
boys that any one
who looked in
through this hole
and knocked at
the slate would
see the dead man
within open his
eyes. Often have
I and my brother
peeped in and
knocked, but the
experiment failed,
because, when the
eye was applied
to the hole, it excluded
external light.</p>

</div>

<p>The monument is still where it was, and is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
same condition. Whether boys still knock and look
in I do not know.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough, a somewhat similar practice
exists at Burghead, about nine miles from Elgin,
which is described by Professor Mitchell in his
“Rhind Lectures,” 1880. He says: “There is a
memorial slab built into the wall of the burial-ground,
called the Chapel Yard, at the south-east
corner; it is 35 inches high by 20 inches wide; close
above it, and also built into the wall, there is a hewn
lintel-like stone, 37 inches long by 1½ inches thick.
On the narrow exposed face of this stone there is no
sculpturing.</p>

<p>“The woodcut shows the position on the cradle
stone (as it is called) of a cup-like hollow, which is
quite round 2¼ inches in depth. This hollow has been
produced by the children of Burghead, who are in
the habit of striking the spot with a beachstone
(which is also represented in the woodcut), and then
quickly putting their ears to the place, when the
sound of a rocking cradle and the crying of a child
are said to be heard, as if coming from a cavern deep
under ground. I am told that during last century
the stone was not visited by children, but by women,
who believed that they were to become mothers if
they heard the rocking of the cradle and the crying
of the child after tapping on the stone.”</p>

<p>What is certainly a curious coincidence is that the
pre-historic rude stone ossuaries, dolmens or cromlechs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
have very frequently in like manner a hole worked in
them.</p>

<p>Trevethy cromlech, in the parish of St. Cleer,
Cornwall, has a hole perforating the capstone. The
Maison des Fées at Grammont, in Hérault, has a hole
bored through the head or western supporter. Another,
now destroyed, was at Cahaignes, in Normandy.
The covered avenue
of Conflans
now transferred
to the fosse of the
Musée, St. Germain,
has not only
the round hole
bored in one upright,
but also the
stone that closed
this opening.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Holes in like manner have been bored in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
cromlechs of Avening and Rodmarton. Those in
Circassia, in Palestine, and in India, have also holes.
Colonel Meadows Taylor found that 1,100 dolmens
out of 2,219 in the Dekhan had these holes in them.
Similar holes have been observed in the dolmens of
Sardinia.</p>

</div>

<p>In a majority of cases these holes will not serve
the purpose of giving admission to the interior of the
monument, though in some large enough. These
megalithic structures were ossuaries; often, no doubt,
the dead was laid in one as he had died; but in a
great many cases, always where the dead had fallen
in battle at a distance from the family mausoleum,
his bones were cleaned of flesh and sinew before
being brought to it. The bones bear marks of
the scraper that cleared them of flesh, and they
are not put together in correct position. In like
manner the Landgrave Ludwig, husband of St.
Elizabeth, died at Otranto, in 1227; his body
was boiled to get the flesh off the bones, and
then the bones alone were conveyed to Germany,
to be interred at Eisenach.</p>

<p>It has often been noticed that along with ordinary
interments in barrows, incineration has been practised.
This was probably another means of transporting the
remains of those who had died at a distance from
the family or clan burial mound.</p>

<p>The holes in the dolmens<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> are in many cases too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
small to allow of anyone crawling through to carry
within the remains of the last member of the family,
who had succumbed and was to be placed in the
dolmen. Some other explanation must be sought.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 46.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE INNER
INCOMPLETE CIRCLE</span>,
<span class="smcap">STONEHENGE</span>, <i>restored</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now, it is remarkable that the circles of upright
stones that enclose cairns and stone graves or kistvaens
are rarely complete. They have been purposely
made imperfect circles, with a gap or a stop
in the circle; and we may ask whether the interruption
in the circle has some meaning analogous to
that of the hole in the stone chest.</p>

<p>Mr. Greenwell, in his “British Barrows,” says:&mdash;“The
incompleteness of these circles is so frequent a
feature in their construction that it cannot be accidental.
They have, moreover, been left incomplete
in some cases in a way which most evidently shows
a design in the operation; as, for instance, where the
circle is formed of a number of stones standing apart
from each other. The space between two of them
has frequently been carefully built up with one large
or several smaller stones. The effect of this is to
break the continuity, or rather the uniformity, of the
circle, and so to make it imperfect. This very remarkable
feature in connection with the enclosing
circles is also found to occur in the case of other
remains which belong to the same period and people
as the barrows. The sculptured markings engraved
upon rocks, and also upon stones forming the covers
of urns or cists, consist in the main of two types, cup-shaped
hollows, and circles, more or less in number,
surrounding in most cases a central cup. In almost
every instance the circle is imperfect, its continuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
being sometimes broken by a duct leading out from
the central cup; at other times by the hollowed line
of the circle stopping short when about to join at
each end. The connection of these sculptured stones,
if so they may be termed, with places of sepulture,
brings them at once into close relationship with the
enclosing circles of barrows, and it is scarcely possible
to imagine but that the same idea, whatever that may
have been, is signified by the incomplete circle in
both cases.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The great inner ring of trilithons at Stonehenge
affects the horse-shoe shape, and is, and
always was, incomplete. The outer
ring of trilithons is too ruinous for us
to be able to state what its original
condition was.</p>

<p>The horse-shoe, the incomplete ring,
is still regarded as lucky, and a protection
against witches. The enchanter
who raised spirits was wont to draw a complete circle
around him, and the demons raged outside this
circle, but could not pass within and hurt him
who had conjured them up. If he stepped outside
the circle, or broke the continuity of the ring, then
the spirits entered and tore him to pieces.</p>

<p>This probably gives us a clue to the signification of
the incomplete circle. The complete circle confines
a spirit within it, or protects from the entrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
spirits; an interrupted circle allows spirits to pass to
and fro, gives ingress and egress.</p>

<p>The tomb is the house of the dead. He lives in it
after some mysterious, not clearly defined fashion.
And as a bee-hive hut had its door, so must the hut
of the dead have its door. It would be a cruelty to
the dead to imprison him; and if the circle be complete,
the dolmen closed in on all sides, he could not
come in and out at pleasure.</p>

<p>Precisely what the door is to the house, that the
mouth is to man; it is the door by which the spirit
comes into and goes out of man. With his first
inspiration he becomes a living soul; with his last
breath he expires&mdash;gives up his soul.</p>

<p>The story is well known of the two shepherds who
sat together one summer’s day. One fell asleep, and
whilst he slept the other saw a bee issue from his lips
and creep over a blade of grass that crossed a tiny
trickle of water, then fly away among flowers. After
an hour the bee returned again in the same way, and
re-entered the sleeping man’s mouth. Thereupon he
awoke, and told his friend that in dream he had
crossed a magnificent bridge over a great river, and
had visited Paradise.</p>

<p>In the Caucasus, among the Abazas, when a boy
dies he is put into a wooden coffin <i>with a hole in it</i>,
and hung up in a tree. Bees are supposed to fly in
and out at the hole, and these are taken, no doubt, to
be souls visiting the boy, and the soul of the boy
going in and out along with them.</p>

<p>I remember some years ago when a person was
dying and seemed to find great difficulty in the parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of soul from body, that the nurse went to the
window and opened it, whereupon the dying person
heaved a sigh, and the spirit took its flight. On asking
the reason of this opening of the window, the
nurse answered, “You would not have the soul go up
the chimney, would you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in his poem “The Gift of
the Sea,” refers to this belief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i3">“The widow ...</div>
<div class="verse">Opened the door on the bitter shore</div>
<div class="verse">To let the soul go free.”</div>

<p>Again, it has often been noticed that holes have
been knocked or bored in funeral urns containing incinerated
bones. These have been made purposely,
and must have had some signification. I have not myself
examined such urns on the spot where discovered;
but I have little hesitation in surmising that only
such urns have been perforated as have had their
mouths covered with another vessel inverted, or with
a flat stone, and that the object of this perforation has
been to make a door of ingress or egress for the spirit
of the dead; that, in fact, it had the same purpose as
the hole in the dolmen and the rupture of continuity
in the circle.</p>

<p>Of a number of the smaller sized urns or vessels
found in the barrows of Salisbury Plain, “a very large
proportion are pierced on one side with two holes,
from half an inch to two inches apart. There are exceptions
with a large number of holes, but the rule is
to have two holes on one side only,” says Mr. Long,
in his “Stonehenge and its Barrows.” He proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to discuss their signification. The holes could not
have existed for suspension, and he adopts Sir C. Colt
Hoare’s supposition that the perforated urns were
incense vessels. But calcined
bones have been found in some,
and others probably served as
caps to the cinerary urns. Almost
certainly the people of
the barrows knew nothing of
incense, and the probability
is that these two holes were
bored as doors of egress and ingress for the spirit
that still tenanted the bones.</p>

<p>Count d’Alviella says in his Hibbert Lectures for
1891, “Numbers of savage peoples suppose that the
soul continues to inhabit the body after death, though
from time to time it makes excursions into the world
of the living. It therefore requires a hole if it is to
escape from the enclosure. For this reason it is that,
at the death of a relative, the Hottentots, the Samoyeds,
the Siamese, the Fijians, and the Redskins,
make a hole in the hut to allow the passage of the
deceased, but close it again immediately afterwards
to prevent its coming back. The Iroquois make a
small hole in every tomb, and expressly declare that
it is to enable the soul to go out and come in at its
pleasure.”</p>

<p>There was another usage of the men of the
megalithic monuments which had, apparently, the
same idea or conception of spirit as that which induced
them to make holes in their dolmens.</p>

<p>In 1873, when the French Association for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Advancement of Science met in Congress at Lyons,
Dr. Prunières produced an elliptical disc of skull which
had been found by him inside a human skull that had
been trepanned, and which came from a dolmen in
Lozère. The disc had been cut out of a human skull
by some sharp instrument at an incline. At first
sight it appeared probable that this piece came
from the skull
in which it was
discovered, but
on close examination
it was
found that it
would not fit
the hole trepanned
in the
skull.</p>

<p>In the same dolmen Dr. Prunières found a second
skull that had been trepanned more than once. Attention
was now drawn to this remarkable phenomenon&mdash;and
instances multiplied to prove that the
men of the polished stone age, the men who erected
Stonehenge and Carnac, were wont to cut holes in
their heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/i_b_262.png" width="455" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 50.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">SKULL THAT HAD BEEN TWICE TREPANNED
FROM A CAVE IN THE PETIT-MORIN.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Prunières especially took the matter up. He
discovered in the dolmens portions of skulls, circular
or elliptical, that had been pierced with holes for
suspension, and had been polished by long continued
wear. In the Cave de l’Homme-Mort, in Lozère, he
exhumed a skull that had a surgical trepanned hole
on the sagittal suture. Finally, in the great ossuary
of Beaumes Chaudes he discovered as many as sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
cranial discs. Skulls began to turn up elsewhere that
had been trepanned, and all of the same epoch. They
came from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Bohemia,
Poland, Spain, Portugal, Algeria. It was found also
that trepanning skulls had been in practice among
the aborigines of America. In the Peabody Museum
is a skull that has had a hole cut out of it. A mound
on the Devil’s River yielded another. Other trepanned
skulls were taken out of mounds near Lake
Huron and Grape Mound. A skull found in a barrow
near the River Detroit had two perforations in it. A
sepulchre near Lima yielded a skull that had also
been surgically treated in the same fashion. Another
came from the basin of the Amazon. There is, however,
a marked difference between the American holed
skulls and these of the neolithic men of Europe. The
American skulls have all been operated on after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
death, and are found only in male skulls. They were,
moreover, made by means of a stone drill which was
turned rapidly round. Only one circular perforation
in every respect similar to these found in Europe has
been noticed in America. We may, therefore, put
aside the pre-historic trepannings of America as not
connected directly with the subject under consideration.
In Europe the majority of the cases show by
evident tokens that the operations were performed
during life. Of these the greatest numbers of
every age and sex have been found in the dolmens of
France.</p>

<p>In the Casa da Moura, a dolmen in Portugal, was
found a skull on which the operation had been begun,
but never completed. It had clearly been worked
with a flint scraper. The Baron de Baye found in
one of the paleolithic caves of Marne a head that had
been twice trepanned.</p>

<p>The great majority of cases of trepanned heads
show that those operated upon had lived for many
years after the operation. Indeed, it cannot be said
that the practice of trepanning is as yet extinct.
Dr. Boulongue, in his work on Montenegro, gives a
long account of this usage of the natives of the Black
Mountain; they have recourse to trepanning on the
smallest provocation, simply because they have headaches.
He quotes numerous instances of persons who
have been trepanned seven and even eight times,
without this materially injuring their health.</p>

<p>In the same manner the Kabyles of Algeria cut
holes in their heads, usually as a cure for epilepsy.</p>

<p>The first example of pre-historic trepanning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was discovered in 1685. Montfaucon mentions
it, but misunderstood it; he supposed that the
man with the hole in his head had been wounded
in battle, but had recovered. A second example
was observed in 1816, and was also misinterpreted.
A sepulchral cave had been opened at
Nogent-les-Vierges, which contained two hundred
skeletons. One of the skulls was found to be trepanned,
and the edges of the wound showed evidence
of the efforts of Nature to repair the injury. This
also was supposed to be a case of wound in battle.</p>

La France Préhistorique</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>It must, however, be observed that the men thus
trepanned lived in the stone age, and that no stone
axe or sword could possibly gash away a slice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
skull; that, moreover, the edges of the holes show
that they have been laboriously worked through at
an incline, the scraper held so as to make the hole
convex, widest at the outer surface, and narrowing
at the inner surface near the brain.</p>

<p>The hole in the head of the man from the Cave of
l’Homme-Mort is peculiarly interesting, as it showed
that he had been trepanned during life, and that
Nature had done her best to smoothe the rough
edges. Then, after death, a flint saw had been used,
to further enlarge the hole. The marks of the two
operations are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Now what, it may be asked, is the meaning of these
holes cut in the head? Various suggestions have
been offered, but the most plausible is this&mdash;that they
were made in cases of epilepsy.</p>

<p>“The art of trepanning,” says Dr. Broca, “was employed
exclusively in cases of spontaneous maladies.
In all likelihood the operation took place in accordance
with certain ideas prevalent relative to nervous
complaints, such as epilepsy, idiotcy, convulsions,
mental alienations, etc. These affections, which
science regards as natural, always struck the imagination
of the vulgar, and were attributed to divine or
demoniacal possession. Who can say whether trepanning
for epilepsy&mdash;a practice now almost abandoned,
but which was formerly in usage, was not
adopted as a means of opening a door by which the
demons possessing the patient might be allowed to
escape?”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>We know how that even in medieval times, the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
spirit exorcised out of a man is represented as a little
figure issuing from his mouth. The primitive medicine-men,
supposing that the epileptic child was possessed
by a spirit, cut a hole in the head, and through this
hole conjured the spirit forth. Then the portion of
the skull cut away obtained a superstitious value, it
had been in contact with a spirit, and so was employed
as an amulet. It is, however, quite possible
that these discs from the heads were worn by the
wives or the mothers of those from whom they were
cut, out of sentiment. In some tombs, male skulls
have been found stuffed with small bones of children,
and not all from the same children; these skulls had
been polished by friction, and seem to have been worn
hung round the neck, and to have served as a sort of
reticule or rather reliquary, in which the widow carried
portions of the various children she had borne, who
had died, packed away in their father’s skull.</p>

<p>So much, then, for perforations in tombstones, interrupted
continuity in circles, and trepanned skulls.
All have the same interpretation, the opening of a
means of egress for the spirit, and are precisely what
the open window means now in a case of death, they
are to the dead man what the door is in the house to
the living man.</p>

<p>There is another usage of a hole that has come
down to us from primeval man in a very modified
form. I refer to the wedding-ring, a piece of
perforated metal through which the finger is thrust.
The marriage ring is a pledge of fidelity, but it must
often have struck English people that it is a very one-sided
arrangement when the woman has to wear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
badge of being married, whereas the man wears none.
The reason why the man wears no ring is probably to
be sought in custom followed from the period when
a man had as many wives as he liked, but the
woman was debarred from belonging to more than
one man.</p>

<p>The passing of the finger through a ring is probably
a survival of the practice of passing the entire body
through a ring as a symbol of covenant, of entering
on new relations, a sort of regeneration into a new
family or fraternity. A great number of holed stones
remain among pre-historic monuments that were
probably so used, for there remained a reminiscence
of such usage in tradition. Wherever megalithic
remains are found, there also these holed stones are
found large enough for the passage of a body; sometimes
only of sufficient size for the hand to be passed
through.</p>

<p>At Boleit in Cornwall in tolerably close juxtaposition
is a circle of 19 upright
stones, 75 feet in diameter,
“The Merry Maidens;” two
menhirs, “The Pipers,” respectively
15 feet and 13½
feet high; another upright
stone 11 feet high, 5 barrows,
and 3 holed stones.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 52.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">MENANTOL, MADRON.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>At Tregaseal, in the same county, are four holed
stones in a line, the hole in each 3¼ to 3¾ inches in
diameter. At St. Buryan, near a sacred circle, is an
upright slab with a hole in it 5¼ inches in diameter.
Another holed stone is at Trelew in St. Buryan, the hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
5 inches in diameter. Another at St. Just, 6 inches in
diameter. Another upright stone 3 feet 3 inches high
at Sancreed has in it a hole 3¼ inches in diameter.
But there are others far larger. The Tolven near
Gweep Constantine has in it a hole 1 foot 4½ inches
in diameter, and the Men-an-tol at Madron, which is
near Lanyon Cromlech and Boskedrian Circle, and is
itself apparently one stone in a ruined circle, has in
it a hole measuring 1 foot 6 inches to 1 foot 9 inches
in diameter. St. Wilfred’s needle in the crypt of
Ripon Minster is a hole bored in the natural rock, and
girls were wont to be passed through it to prove their
virtue. If they stuck in the eye of the needle they
were held to be dishonest.</p>

<p>At Chagford in Devon again we find in connection
a sacred circle, avenues, and a tolmen, or holed stone
3 feet in diameter. So also on Brimham Moor in
Yorkshire; there within the memory of old men, holed
stones have been used for passing children through
to remove disorders. But the original purpose for
which the tolmens were set up is almost certainly to furnish
a means for making a covenant, for taking an oath.
The woman was passed through the perforated stone
before she married, as an assurance to the bridegroom
that she was a pure virgin. Those entering on a
covenant crawled through the hole one after another,
in pledge of their having no <i>arrière pensée</i>, that they
took the pledge to each other in full faith. There
are several curious passages in the Icelandic sagas
that illustrate this custom. The Icelanders were a
very different race from the men who erected the
megalithic monuments, but their Scandinavian ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
came on the traces of the neolithic men, subdued
them, and adopted many of their usages. In
Iceland there are no holed stones, but the principle
of passing through a hole was followed, and it assumed
this curious form. A turf was cut so that it held in
the ground at both ends, then it was raised in the
midst, and those who entered on a covenant of
brotherhood with each other crawled under the
turf.</p>

<p>A ballad sung by the peasantry in the West of
England relates how a gay trooper loved a fair
damsel, and married her in military fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse ic">“My sword it is a Damask blade,</div>
<div class="verse i2">I bend it in a bow.</div>
<div class="verse">No golden ring may here be got,</div>
<div class="verse i2">So pass thy white hand through.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here the hoop of steel has taken the place of the
holed stone. The golden circlet has, however, become
the usual substitute.</p>

<p>We will now consider some holes of a different
description, that are not actual perforations. A
custom very general in Roman Catholic countries
must have struck travellers: it is that of placing cups,
basins, or other concave vessels on graves. The
purpose is that they may be filled with holy water&mdash;or
if not with that, then with the dew of heaven.
The friends, kindred, or charitable as they pass dip a
little brush in the basin and sprinkle the grave with
the water. This is a symbolic act, nothing more.
It means that the visitor to the grave wishes well to
the dead, and offers a prayer for the refreshment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the departed soul. That soul may be in purgatory,
and he who sprinkles the grave knows that no drops
of water thrown on the mound can slake the fire that
tortures the soul, but he acts as though he thought
that the soul still tenanted the body, and could be
refreshed by the water thrown on his grave. I do
not believe this usage to have received any formal
sanction; it is a survival of a much earlier usage that
has been given an altered signification. It is not a
rational proceeding, but is not one particle more
irrational than our putting wreaths and crosses of
flowers on the graves of those we have loved. I
remember a daughter planting ferns of many sorts
round her mother’s tomb, “because mother was so
very fond of ferns.” But those who thus act, when
they consider, know well enough that what lies underground
is the decaying husk, and that the soul, the
true being, is elsewhere. Nevertheless, the mind, by
force of custom and natural tendency, persists in
associating soul with body after death, and the dead
lady was given her ferns because they continued to
give her pleasure, whilst lying in her grave, precisely
as the Tartar chief is given his horse and his wives
slain and laid about him in his cairn.</p>

<p>The original signification of the basin or cup on
the tomb was that of a vessel to contain the drink
supplied to the dead. The dead man continued to
eat and drink in his cairn or dolmen, and the
relatives supplied him with what he required.</p>

<p>In the British tumuli, hollows beside the dead are
of common occurrence. Mr. Greenwell says: “It is
of frequent occurrence to find holes, sunk below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
natural surface, within the area of a barrow, and not
usually in close proximity to any interment, though
in some instances such has been found to be the case.
Sometimes as many as four or five have been met
with in a single barrow. They are of various sizes,
and differ in shape, but they are generally circular,
about 1½ feet in diameter, and the same in depth. In
the greater number of cases they are filled with the
ordinary materials of which the mound itself is composed,
and contain nothing besides; but at other
times pieces of animal, and much more rarely of
human bones, charcoal, potsherds, and burnt earth,
and stone are found in them.... It has suggested
itself to me, that they may have been made as receptacles
of food or of some other perishable material,
and that they answered the same purpose as the
vessels of pottery are supposed to have done, which
are such frequent accompaniments of a burial. Their
not being usually placed in close contact with the
body is a fact not perhaps very consistent with this
explanation of their purpose, but I am unable to offer
any one more suggestion.”</p>

<p>I differ from Mr. Greenwell in one point only&mdash;that
these basins being at a distance from the body
may be inconsistent with the explanation he proposes.
On the contrary, I conceive that these cup-like
hollows were at the circumference of the original
mound, and were often replenished with food
or drink. As the mound spread through the
action of rain, or as other interments were made
in it, and it was enlarged, these basins became
buried.</p>

<p>The parkin cakes baked in Yorkshire in November,
the simnel or soul-mass cakes of Lancashire, the
<i>gauffres</i> baked at All Souls-tide in Belgium, are all
reminiscences of the food prepared and offered to the
dead at All Souls, the great day of commemoration
of the departed. Not only did the living eat the
cakes, but they were given as well to the dead. In
Belgium the idea still holds that the pancakes or
<i>gauffres</i> avail the souls; but through a confusion of
ideas, the ignorant suppose that the living by eating
them satisfy the dead, and as these pancakes are very
indigestible, it is customary to hire robust men to
gorge themselves on <i>gauffres</i> so as to content the departed
ones with a good meal. A has a dear deceased
relative B. In order that B may be well supplied with
pancake, A ought to eat a plentiful supply; but A
shrinks from an attack of indigestion, which a surfeit
would bring on, so he hires C to glut himself on
<i>gauffres</i> in his room.</p>

<p>The Flemish name for these cakes are “zielen
brood” or soul-bread. “At Dixmude and its neighbourhood
it is said that for every cake eaten a soul
is delivered from purgatory. At Furnes the same
belief attaches to the little loaves called ‘radetjes,’
baked in every house. At Ypres the children beg in
the street on the eve of All Souls for some sous
wherewith ‘to make cakes for the little souls in
purgatory.’ At Antwerp these soul-cakes are stained
yellow with saffron, to represent the flames of purgatory.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
In the North of England all idea as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
connection between these cakes and the dead is lost,
but the cakes are still made. This custom is a transformation
under Christian influence of the still earlier
usage of putting food on the graves. When food and
drink were furnished to the dead, then necessarily the
dead must have their mugs and platters for the
reception of their food, and the basins scooped in
the soil of a barrow in all likelihood served this
purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>In like manner there are basins cut on some of the
dolmens, and other depressions that were natural were
employed for the same purpose. On the coverer of a
dolmen close to the railway at Assier, in the Department
of Lot, is such a rock basin, natural perhaps,
but if natural, then utilised for the purpose of a food
or drink vessel for the dead. Another dolmen in the
same department, at Laramière, has one distinctly cut
by art at the eastern extremity of the covering stone.
Inside dolmens and covered avenues stones have
been found with cup-like hollows scooped out in
them. These served the same purpose, and were
in such monuments as were accessible in the interior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
as, for instance, those stone basins found
in the stone-vaulted tombs on the banks of the
Boyne, near Drogheda, with their singular inscribed
circles. Whereas such dolmens as could not be
entered had the food or drink basins outside
them.</p>

<p>“The Three Brothers of Grugith,” a cromlech or
dolmen at S. Kévern, in Cornwall,
has eight cup-like hollows
on the coverer and one in one of
the uprights. They vary from 4
to 6 inches in diameter and are
1½ inches deep.</p>

<p>The cup-like holes found so
frequently in connection with
palæolithic monuments may probably
be explained in this way.
Originally intended as actual
food receptacles or cups for drink, they came in time
to be employed as a mere form, and no particular
care was taken as to the position they occupied.
Thus, very often an upright stone has these cup-marks
on it; sometimes they are on the under surface of a
covering stone. They belong to the period of the rude
stone monuments. With the advent of bronze they
gradually disappear. They are not found always
associated with interments, though generally so,
and it is probable that the stones bearing them
which do not at present seem to be intended to
mark the place of an interment may have done so
originally.</p>

<p>We know that in a great number of cases a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
symbol was taken to serve the purpose of something
of actual, material use. Thus, the Chinese draw
little coats and hats on paper and burn them,
and suppose that by this means they are transmitting
actual coats and hats to their ancestors in the
world of spirits. In Rome, at certain periods, statuettes
were thrown into the Tiber: these were substitutes for
the human sacrifices formerly offered to the river.
Probably the custom of giving food and drink to the
dead gradually died out among the palæolithic men,
but that of making the cups for the reception of the
gifts remained, and as their purpose was forgotten,
the stones graven with the hollows were set up
anyhow.</p>

<p>The question has been often raised whether the
rock-basins found on granite heights are of artificial
origin. It is perhaps too hastily concluded that
they are produced by water and gravel rotating
in the wind. No doubt a good many have this
origin; but I hardly think that all are natural, and it is
probable that some have been begun by art and then
enlarged by nature, and also that natural basins
may have been used by the palæolithic men as
drink or food vessels for the gods or spirits in the
wind.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 55.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">MENHIR, LEW TRENCHARD.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>About twelve years ago I dug up a <i>menhir</i> that
had lain for certainly three centuries under ground,
and had served on one side as a wall for the “leat”
or conduit of water to the manorial mill. There was
no mistaking the character of the stone. It was of
fine grained granite, and had been brought from a
distance of some eight miles. It was unshaped at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the base, and marked exactly how much of it had
been sunk in the ground. It stood when re-erected
10 feet 10 inches above the surface. The singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
feature in it is this. At the summit, which measures
15 inches by 12 inches, is a small cup 3 inches deep
sunk in the stone, 4½ inches in diameter, and distinctly
artificial. Now, that the monolith had been
standing upright for a vast number of years, was
shown by this fact, that the rain water, accumulating
in the artificial cup, driven by the prevailing S.W.
wind, had worn for itself a lip, and in its flow had cut
itself a channel down the side of the stone opposite
to the direction of the wind to the distance of 1 foot
6 inches.</p>

</div>

<p>What can this cup have been intended for? It is
probable that it was a receptacle for rain water, which
was to serve for the drink of the dead man above
whom the monolith was erected. The Rev. W. C.
Lukis, one of the highest authorities on such matters,
was with me at the time of the re-erection of this monolith,
and it then occurred to him that the holes at the
top of so many of the Brittany menhirs, in which now
crosses are planted, were not made for the reception
of the bases of these crosses, but already existed in
the menhirs, and were utilised in Christian times for
the erection therein of crosses which sanctified the
old heathen monuments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Some upright stones have the cup-hollows cut in
their sides, so that nothing could rest in
them; but I venture to suggest that
these may be symbolic cups, carved after
their use, as food and drink receptacles,
had been abandoned.</p>

<p>“From the fact of cup-markings being found in so
many instances directly associated with sepulchral
remains, I think it may fairly be inferred that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
are connected in some way or other with funeral rites,
either as sacred emblems or for actual use in holding
small offerings or libations.”</p>

<p>Mr. Romilly Allen is, I believe, quite right in his conjecture,
which is drawn from observation of the frequency
with which these cup-hollows are associated
with sepulchral stones. But it must be remembered
that a libation is the last form assumed by the usage of
giving a drink to either the dead or to a god. The
conception of a sacrifice is comparatively modern, the
primitive idea in connection with the offering of a
liquid is the giving of some acceptable draught to
some being who is in the spirit world.</p>

<p>The fact, and it is a fact, that these cup-markings
are found on Christian tombstones, shows how the
old habit continued to find expression after the meaning
which had originated it was completely lost.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>These singular cup-markings are found distributed
over Denmark, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, England,
France, Switzerland.</p>

</div>

<p>All cup-hollows cannot indeed be explained as
drink vessels for the dead.
Those, for instance, carved in
the slate at a steep incline of
the cliffs near New Quay in
Cornwall, and others in the
perpendicular face of the rock
also in the same place cannot
be so interpreted, but their
character is not that altogether
of the cup-markings found elsewhere. The hollows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
are often numerous, and are irregularly distributed.
Sometimes they have a channel surrounding
a group. That they had some well-understood
meaning to the people of the neolithic age who
graved them in the rock cannot be doubted. It is
said that in places grease and oil are still put into
them by the ignorant peasantry as oblation; and
this leads to the conclusion that, when first graven,
they were intended as receptacles for offerings.</p>

<p>One day, in a graveyard in the west of England, I
came on an old stone basin,
locally termed a “Lord’s measure,”
an ancient holy-water
vessel,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> standing under the
headstone, above a mound that
covered the dust of someone
who had been dearly loved.
The little basin was full of water, and in the water
were flowers.</p>

<p>As I stood musing over this grave, it was not wonderful
that my mind should travel back through vast
ages, and follow man in his various moods, influenced
in his treatment of the dead by various doctrines
relative to the condition of the soul.</p>

<p>Here was the cup for holy water, itself a possible
descendant of the food-vessel for the dead. And
now it is used, not to furnish the dead with drink and
meat, but with flowers. And it seemed to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
man was the same in all ages, through all civilisations,
and that his acts are governed much more by custom
than by reason. Is it not quite as irrational to put
flowers on a grave as to put on it cake or ale? Does
the soul live in the green mound with the bones?
Does it come out to smell and admire the roses and
lilies and picotees? The putting flowers on the
grave is a matter of sentiment. Quite so&mdash;and in a
certain phase of man’s growth in culture the food-vessel
was cut in stone as a mere matter of sentiment,
even when no food was put in it.</p>

<p>There are many of the customs of daily life which
deserve to be considered, and which are to us full of
interest, or ought to be so, for they tell us such a
wondrous story. If I have in this little volume given
a few instances, it is with the object of directing
attention to the survivals of usage which had its
origin in ideas long ago abandoned, and to show how
much there is still to be learned from that proper
study of mankind&mdash;Man.</p>

<p>Archæology is considered a dry pursuit, but it ceases
to be dry when we find that it does not belong solely
to what is dead and passed, but that it furnishes us
with the interpretation of much that is still living and
is not understood.</p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII.<br />
<span class="old">Raising the Hat</span>.</h2>


<p>It is really remarkable how many customs are
allowed to pass without the idea occurring as to
what is their meaning. There is, for instance, no
more common usage of everyday life than that of
salutation by raising the hat, or touching the cap,
and yet, not one person in ten thousand stops to
inquire what it all means&mdash;why this little action of
the hand should be accepted as a token of respect.</p>

<p>Raising the hat is an intermediate form; the
putting up the finger to the cap is the curtailed idea
of the primitive act of homage, reduced to its most
meagre expression.</p>

<p>There is an amusing passage in Sir Francis Head’s
“Bubbles from the Brunnen of Nassau” on hat-lifting:</p>

<p>“At nearly a league from Langen-Schwalbach, I
walked up to a little boy who was flying a kite on
the top of a hill, in the middle of a field of oat-stubble.
I said not a word to the child&mdash;scarcely
looked at him; but as soon as I got close to him, the
little village clod, who had never breathed anything
thicker than his own mountain air, actually almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
lost string, kite, and all, in an effort, quite irresistible,
which he made to bow to me, and take off his hat.
Again, in the middle of the forest, I saw the other
day three labouring boys laughing together, each of
their mouths being, if possible, wider open than the
others; however, as they separated, off went their
caps, and they really took leave of each other in the
very same sort of manner with which I yesterday saw
the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg return a bow to a
common postillion.” Then Sir Francis Head goes on
to moralise on courtesy, but never for a moment
glances at the very curious question, “What is the
meaning of this act? What was the original signification
of this which is now a piece of formal expression
of mutual respect?”</p>

<p>The raising the hat is in act similar to the subscription
to a letter, “your humble servant,” the recognition
of being in subjection to the person saluted.</p>

<p>To wear a hat, a covering to the head, was a symbol
of authority and power. The crown is merely the
head-cover originally worn by the sovereign alone.
Afterwards to cover the head signified the possession
of freedom, and the slave was bare-headed. When,
among the Romans, a slave was manumitted, that
slave, as badge of his being thenceforth a free man,
assumed the Phrygian cap. On numerous monuments,
Roman masters exhibited their munificence to
their slaves by engraving caps of liberty, each cap
signifying a slave who had been set free.</p>

<p>This is the meaning of the Cap of Liberty. On
the murder of Caligula, the mob hoisted Phrygian
caps on poles, and ran about with them shouting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
they were no longer slaves. The death of the tyrant
released them from a servile position.</p>

<p>In mediæval Germany, the giving of a hat was a
symbolic act, conveying with it feudal tenure. He
who received the hat put his hand into it, as a sign
that he grasped all those rights which sprang out of
the authority conveyed to him by the presentation of
the hat. The Pope, when creating a Cardinal, sends
him a scarlet hat. The wearing the hat was allowed
only to nobles and freemen&mdash;no serf might assume
one. Among the Goths, the priests as well as the
nobles wore the head covered.</p>

<p>When Gessler set a hat on a pole, it was a token
that he was exercising sovereign authority. The
elevation of a hat on a pole was also a summons of
vassals to war, like the raising of a royal standard.
In a French Court of Justice, the judges alone wear
their heads covered, in token that they are in exercise
of authority there. So in our own universities, the
tutor or lecturer wears his square cap. So in the
cathedral, a bishop was wont to have his head covered
with the mitre; and in a parish church, the pastor
wore a biretta. We take off our hats when entering
church to testify our homage and allegiance to God;
and so in old Catholic ritual, the priest and bishop
removed their headgear at times, in token that they
received their offices from God.</p>

<p>It roused the Romans to anger because the fillet of
royalty was offered to Julius Cæsar. This was the
merest shred of symbol&mdash;yet it meant that he alone
had a right to wear a cover on his head; in other
words, that all save he were vassals and serfs. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
presentation by Mark Antony brought discontent
to a head, and provoked the assassination of Cæsar.</p>

<p>Odin, the chief god of Norse mythology, is called
Hekluberand, the Hood-bearer; he alone has his head
covered. As god of the skies this no doubt refers to
the cloud-covering, but it implies also his sovereignty.
So Heckla is not only the covered mountain, but the
king or chief of the mountains of Iceland.</p>

<p>We can now see exactly what is the meaning of
doffing the cap. It implies that the person uncovering
his head acknowledges himself to be the serf of
the person before whom he uncovers, or at all events
as his feudal inferior. How completely this is forgotten
may be judged in any walk abroad we take&mdash;when
we uncover to an ordinary acquaintance&mdash;or
we can see it in the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg
removing his hat to the postillion. The curtsey, now
almost abandoned, is the bowing of the knee in worship;
so is the ordinary bend of the body; even the
nod of the head is a symbolic recognition of inferiority
in the social scale to the person saluted.</p>

<p>The head is the noblest part of man, and when he
lifts his hat that covers it, he implies, or rather did
imply at one time, that his head was at the disposal
of the person to whom he showed this homage.</p>

<p>There is a curious story in an Icelandic saga of the
eleventh century in illustration of this. A certain
Thorstein the Fair had killed Thorgils, son of an old
bonder in Iceland, named also Thorstein, but surnamed
“The White,” who was blind. The rule in
Iceland was&mdash;a life for a life, unless the nearest
relative of the fallen man chose to accept blood-money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Five years after the death of Thorgils,
Thorstein the Fair came to Iceland and went at once
to the house of his namesake, White Thorstein, and
offered to pay blood-money for the death of Thorgils,
as much as the old man thought just. “No,”
answered the blind bonder, “I will not bear my son
in my purse.” Thereupon, Fair Thorstein went to
the old man and laid his head on his knees, in token
that he offered him his life. White Thorstein said,
“I will not have your head cut off at the neck.
Moreover, it seems to me that the ears are best where
they grow. But this I adjudge&mdash;that you come here,
into my house, with all your possessions, and live with
me in the place of my son whom you slew.” And
this Fair Thorstein did.</p>

<p>At a period when no deeds were executed in parchment,
symbolic acts were gone through, which had
the efficacy of a legal deed in the present day.</p>

<p>When Harald Haarfager undertook to subdue the
petty kings of Norway, one of these kings, Hrollaug,
seeing that he had not the power to withstand
Harald, “went to the top of the mound on which the
kings were wont to sit, and he had his throne set up
thereon and seated himself upon it. Then he had a
number of feather beds laid on a bench below, on
which the earls were wont to be seated, and he threw
himself down from the throne, and rolled on to the
earls’ bench, thus giving himself out to have taken on
him the title and position of an earl.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And King
Harald accepted this act as a formal renunciation of
his royal title. Every head covering was a badge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
nobility, from the Crown to the Cap of Maintenance,
through all degrees of coronet. In 1215, Hugh,
Bishop of Liège, attended the synod in the Lateran,
and first he took his place on the bench wearing a
mantle and tunic of scarlet, and a green cap to show
he was a count, then he assumed a cap with lappets (?)
<i>manicata</i>, to show he was a duke, and lastly put on his
mitre and other insignia as a bishop. When Pope Julius
II. conferred on Henry VIII. the title of “Defender of
the Faith,” he sent him as symbols of authority a sword
and a cap of crimson velvet turned up with ermine.</p>

<p>It is probable that originally to uncover the head
signified that he who bared his head acknowledged
the power and authority of him whom he saluted to
deal with his head as he chose. Then it came to
signify, in the second place, recognition of feudal
superiority. Lastly, it became a simple act of courtesy
shown to anyone.</p>

<p>In the same way every man in France is now
Monsieur, <i>i.e.</i>, my feudal lord; and every man in
Germany Mein Herr; and every man in England
Mr., <i>i.e.</i>, Master. The titles date from feudal times,
and originally implied feudal subjection. It does so
no longer. So also the title of Esquire implies a right
to bear arms. The Squire in the parish was the only
man in it who had his shield and crest. The Laird in
a Scottish country place is the Lord, the man to whom
all looked for their bread. So words and usages
change their meaning, and yet are retained by habit,
ages after their signification is lost.</p>

Other Verses. By <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>. <i>Fourth Edition. Crown</i>

<p class="p3">‘Mr. Kipling’s verse is strong, vivid, full of character.... Unmistakable genius
rings in every line.’&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="p3">‘The disreputable lingo of Cockayne is henceforth justified before the world; for a
man of genius has taken it in hand, and has shown, beyond all cavilling, that in
its way it also is a medium for literature. You are grateful, and you say to
yourself, half in envy and half in admiration: “Here is a <i>book</i>; here, or one is a
Dutchman, is one of the books of the year.”’&mdash;<i>National Observer.</i></p>

<p class="p3">‘“Barrack-Room Ballads” contains some of the best work that Mr. Kipling has
ever done, which is saying a good deal. “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,” “Gunga Din,” and
“Tommy,” are, in our opinion, altogether superior to anything of the kind that
English literature has hitherto produced.’&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class="p3">‘These ballads are as wonderful in their descriptive power as they are vigorous in
their dramatic force. There are few ballads in the English language more
stirring than “The Ballad of East and West,” worthy to stand by the Border
ballads of Scott.’&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="p3">‘The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We read them
with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses, the cunningly ordered
words tingle with life; and if this be not poetry, what is?’&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="p3">‘The greatest world-poem of the nineteenth century next to “Faust.” “Brand”
will have an astonishing interest for Englishmen. It is in the same set with
“Agamemnon,” with “Lear,” with the literature that we now instinctively regard
as high and holy.’&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
